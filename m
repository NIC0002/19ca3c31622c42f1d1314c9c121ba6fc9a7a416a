It's one thing to describe commit ranges, and another to include every
possible rev-list option.

I think supporting these descriptive ranges is nice, but doesn't _need_
to be in v1 of the tool. If we need to bake them into the CLI from v1
in order to ensure compatibility, then I understand that.

However, I think very few of these should be generally supported, and
if there are reasons to include some then they should be motivated by
a specific use case and tested directly.

As it is, these tags do something in this v1, but we can't really be
sure that they work because we're not testing them. That is my
primary complaint. And testing each individually isn't enough,
because they can combine in all sorts of ways.

The only way I can see using setup_revisions() safely is if you make
sure to reject any arguments that start with "--" (or perhaps "-"
because some of those options may have single-character versions).
This could be extended to an allowlist if we find a motivation to
include other options (I see "--not" as being a likely candidate)
in patches that test that interaction.

Or, could we extract the portion of setup_revisions() that parses
just the revision ranges in to a new setup_revision_ranges() method?
It could reject any options that are not directly about revision
ranges. This option makes less sense if we are going the allowlist
approach.
