By default, pathspec matching does not take "**" specially, making it
equivalen to "*", but it can match "/".  Thus "./**/main.c" is the same
as "*/main.c" (the leading "./" always matches) and matches paths with
at least one "/" in it (thus "*/main.c" does not match "main.c").

If you use ":(glob)./**/main.c", it uses shell glob matching, where "**"
is special and "/**/" can match "/", but "*" does not match "/".
