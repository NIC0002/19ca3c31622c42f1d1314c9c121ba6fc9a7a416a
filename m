I'm afraid it is not obvious to me. As far as I can see the only test 
that does not have this prerequisite is 'cannot access if owned by root' 
added in patch 3. That test needs a setup test to run first which 
requires sudo so there is no point running it if this prerequisite is 
not satisfied.

That was not clear to me. Prerequisites are evaluated once and the 
result is cached. Making it lazy just means it is evaluated when it is 
first required rather than when it is defined. You're right that we want 
to avoid sudo hanging because it is waiting for a password. We should 
define something like

sudo () {
	command sudo -n "$@"
}

to avoid that.

I think I'm using the default configuration for that setting (or at 
least the default configured by the linux distribution I'm using).

Two of the most important promises the suite makes are that (i) tests do 
not write outside $TEST_DIRECTORY and (ii) the tests are not affected by 
the user's or system's git config files. By having $HOME point to /root 
we are clearly violating the second promise and making it much easier to 
accidentally violate the first by inadvertently writing to $HOME.

exactly, they are just examples and show why setting HOME=root is a bad idea

I think $HOME is important enough to worry about because the test suite 
deliberately resets to avoid reading the user's config. Whether some 
other random variable such as GIT_COMMITTER_DATE is set or not does not 
matter in the same way.

It would be better to call git via a wrapper that sets HOME correctly

Being vague by design is unhelpful, just because it is difficult to list 
all the possible implications of a changes does not mean that one should 
not list the important known issues. Commit messages should be 
transparent about the known implications of the changes the commit 
introduces and whether there are likely to be other unanticipated 
implications.

Indeed - I brought it up because we're reusing IKNOWWHATIAMDOING but not 
documenting that we using it in a different way.

I think it's pretty common to use -C in the test suite when running git 
in a repository that is a subdirectory of $TEST_DIRECTORY.
