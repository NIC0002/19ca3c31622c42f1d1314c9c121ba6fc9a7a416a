"starting with the current" may be a correct statement of the fact,
but it is totally unclear what the relevance it has to the problem
being solved. Rather, it is unclear what problem you are solving.

Is it 

 - We search through the worktrees, starting with the current one,
   and stop at the first one found.

 - If the current branch the the current worktree is checked out in
   a different worktree, we get the current worktree back.

 - There are callers that want to know ONLY about other worktrees;
   they check the returned value and when they see it is the current
   one, they happily ignores the fact that it might be checked out
   elsewhere as well.

It is somewhat disturbing that your solution only needs to "ignore"
the current one.  Whatever problem you are seeing by the current
code not ignoring the current worktree, wouldn't we have a similar
problem if two non-current worktrees checked out the same branch?
Would it not be a problem because any non-current worktree returned
by the function triggers the "already checked-out" safety mechanism?
