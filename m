That seems like a reasonable fix (and I think we do it elsewhere). But I
wonder if it wouldn't be simpler to just unconditionally initialize the
rev_info in cmd_pack_objects(), and then unconditionally release it.
True, we _might_ not use it if we are receiving objects directly over
stdin, but I don't think initializing it is particularly costly.

And then we don't have to worry about whether it's valid (it always is),
or about copying between two representations of the filter (there's only
one).
