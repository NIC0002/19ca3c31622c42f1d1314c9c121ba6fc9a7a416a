Just to confirm, this is commit f770e9f39, correct?

I found a few related issues here. The biggest one is that we use Jenkins for our build. It looks like the TTY determinations are failing when in Jenkins but not outside. So an inaccessible stdin is causing test issues. Also when stderr=stdout is also causing issues. For t7031, there is a library conflict when we run with OpenSSH 8 with Git built with OpenSSL 1.1.1 vs. 3.0.4 - so that conflict is a configuration issue. We do all kinds of built/tests with those, so that explains that.

So other than t7031, the tests ran correctly when I did them manually, but not in Jenkins.
