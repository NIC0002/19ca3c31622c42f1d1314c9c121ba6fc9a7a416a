Hmm. If it's giving us the total size, that seems like it may fail in a
case like this:

  - we write a smaller amount to the pipe, say 7168 bytes. That leaves
    1024 bytes in the buffer. The reader reads nothing yet.

  - now we try to write another 4096 bytes. That's too big, so we get
    ENOSPC. But when we ask for the pipe size, it tells us 8192. So we
    _don't_ try to do a partial write of the remaining size, and return
    EAGAIN. But now we've made no forward progress (i.e., even though
    poll() said we could write, we don't, and we end up in the xwrite
    loop).

So we really do want to try to get a partial write. Even a single byte
means we are making forward progress.

It's definitely not optimal, but it may not be too bad. If we cut the
size in half each time, then at worst we make log2(N) extra write
attempts, and we end up with a partial write within 50% of the optimal
size.
