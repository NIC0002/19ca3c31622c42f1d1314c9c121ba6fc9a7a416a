There's some nice suggestions at:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4219255/how-do-you-get-the-list-of-targets-in-a-makefile

I managed to get pretty close to this by massaging the various parsers
that were suggested there.

But I wonder if defining help as we go along wouldn't be the best and
least likely to break, and most likely to be kept up-to-date. I.e. some
variant of the comments added there.

Or better (maybe it's discussed in that SO thing, I didn't skim it all),
something like:

    HELP_all = the default target
    all::
    [...]

We could then even print a heading showing what target(s) we're running
by looking at MAKECMDGOALS.

Also, Elia's ad-hoc script here copied from StackOverflow looks awfully
similar to what I have in /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/make
installed with my OS. Available here:
https://github.com/scop/bash-completion/blob/master/completions/make

So maybe we could just make this an optional target that depended on
that widely-available bash completion?

That would also have the nice benefit that to the extent that the output
sucked we could maybe massage our Makefile a bit to make it better, and
then we'd not only benefit "make help" users, but anyone doing "make
<TAB>".
