Noted. I see that the series is now in `next` [Thank you], so not worth
the churn of a patch, unless folks start noticing..

It's the Catch 22 problem for deleted capabilities, which we rarely see
because we normally have backward compatibility.

From my perspective, users should then be purging _all_ their `preserve`
configurations once they hit such errors. As the v2.34.0 change
propagates through the Git ecosystem, hopefully it'll be a sufficient
prompt for those who haven't realised that the option can be 'hidden' in
their configuration options.

Time will tell.
