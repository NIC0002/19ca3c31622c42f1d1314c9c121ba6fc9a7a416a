I have updated the PR after suggestions from Hannes. Mainly these changes have been made:

* The reset command dialog uses "mixed" as the default, but is more convenient to navigate with the keyboard.
* Remove and checkout branch commands now have branch selection dialogs if there is more than one branch head on the selected commit.
* Remove and checkout branch command patches handles a few more cases regarding remote branches and detached heads that I didn't think about originally. This has made them larger.
* I have split one commit, added another and moved some functionality around. Because of this the original patch number are no longer in sync with GitHub. How should I handle that?

@Paul Mackerras: Paul, can you have a look at this? Can you accept a PR through GitGitGadget if I rebase it onto master for git.ozlabs.org/~paulus/gitk? Or do you have some other preferred way to receive patches?

Best regards,
Jens LidestrÃ¶m
