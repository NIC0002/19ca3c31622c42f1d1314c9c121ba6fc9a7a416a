No. no. it's not for the previous replay i am asking for.

Back in the days, I was asked by =C3=86var Arnfj=C3=B6r=C3=B0 Bjarmason.
" * It's unclear if you mean that we'd commit the generated files or
   not. If "not" then our Makefile will need to learn to do two-stage
   compilation. I.e. we'd ship a copy of the makeheader tool, build
   that, build the headers, and then do our "real" build."
My answer was.
"There are different ways we can install the makeheaders tool."

As the related question asked, I remembered it. so, I asked as this
will solve the cross-compilation problem also, if it is good.

You repeated the question for me so, really sorry.

I know you have already told me that, and it is important also as
generally people try to find documentation for function in the header
file. It is also not good when sharing libraries and its related
header files without documentation.

I tried to find the solution.
By reading the manual and By viewing the source code, I found it
doesn't support it.
So, I am going to either modify it or create a new one.
And also I have remembered all your points, I will try to implement it.

No. no. you don't need to be sorry.
I know this proposal is not going to be accepted now.
Too many things have to be done here and I am working on it.
My question was.
1. Until now, are there any problems which need to be solved.
2. Why it gives errors in CI / win test (8) (pull_request) test. (Important=
)
