There was a security warning noted in recent maintenance releases, see
https://lore.kernel.org/git/20220414003839.1616296-2-gitster@pobox.com/
where users could be fooled to access unsafe repositories that they
didn't own.

You may have received a maintenance update that makes this check now the
default.

Could you check what `git version` reports?Â 

There has also been added an escape hatch of allowing "*" for the
permitted safe directories. but do check the updated manuals, and the
git mailing list archive (update the search in the above link).
