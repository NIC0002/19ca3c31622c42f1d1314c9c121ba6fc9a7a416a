From the user's perspective, this is weirdly inconsistent with the
existing diff attributes, which would be more like:

  # in .gitattributes
  *.json diff=json 

  # in config
  [diff "json"]
  algorithm = histogram

I know why one might choose the scheme you did; it kicks in if the repo
sets the algorithm, without users having to set up any extra config.
Which is sort of nice, if we assume that malicious actors don't have any
incentive to pick the algorithm. In theory they don't, though I saw Ã†var
mention possible DoS elsewhere in the thread.

  Side note: It's also possible that algorithm selection could be
  required to trigger a separate security bug (say, a buffer overflow in
  the patience code or something), so restricting that works in a
  belt-and-suspenders way. But that somehow feels like like the wrong
  side of the paranoia-vs-feature line.

So I dunno. I recognize that this scheme fulfills your immediate needs
better, but I fear that we'll be stuck with a weird split between "diff"
and "diff-*" attributes forever. In the long run, having a way for the
repo to say "and here is some config I recommend to you" would give you
the best of both, but that is a challenging topic that has been
discussed and punted on for many years.
