Hi Gabor,

thanks a lot for your detailed reply! I tried that and it works, thank you.

Just another small follow-up question, out of curiosity: I noticed that zsh 
handles the alias completion correctly out of the box (using the exact same 
gitconfig file). I don't have any dedicated zsh completion file, just 
installed zsh via apt. Do you know why and how zsh handles this differently?

Kind regards,
Tim
