Yeah, I hadn't really dug into the rest of the thread and didn't
understand what that part was trying to do. So I left it untouched in my
examples as an exercise for the reader. :)

If you do:

  $url = quotemeta($url);

then you can drop the "e" from the regex, which gets rid of the gross
concatenation:

  $cmdline =~ s[\sorigin\s][ $url ];

I think "\b" for a word boundary would avoid the whitespace
prefix/suffix hackery, but it also matches non-alphabetics (like "/").
You could use alternation, though, like:

  $ cmdline='origin notorigin origin originnot origin/foo origin'
  $ remote_url=real_url
  $ perl -e '
      my ($cmdline, $url) = @ARGV;
      $url = quotemeta($url);
      $cmdline =~ s/(\s|^)origin(\s|$)/$1$url$2/g;
      print $cmdline;
    ' "$cmdline" "$remote_url"
  real_url notorigin real_url originnot origin/foo real_url

Negative lookbehind and lookahead get rid of the "$1" and "$2", but they
are magical-looking, as you noted above. Possibly "/x" and some
whitespace would make the whole thing more readable.
