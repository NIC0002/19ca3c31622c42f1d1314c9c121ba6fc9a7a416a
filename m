Maybe we make it fail for no reason.  Thank you for thinking about this with
depth.

I know you are aware, but for other readers;  In another thread, a bug-fix is
being reviewed that, if accepted, will affect "bisect".  With that fix, the
phrase "checking out may fail" will become "checking out will fail".  But does
it need to fail?

As you said, we want to reject normal check outs of a branch when that
branch is already checked out in other worktrees.  Because of this, sounds
reasonable to leave the implicit 'checkout' in 'bisect reset' to fail in those
cases, and just add some tests to notice if this changes in the future.

But, and this is what makes me think that "checking out will fail" is the wrong
choice for "bisect", while bisecting, with the worktree in a detached HEAD
state, the branch to which "bisect reset" will check out back (BISECT_START),
is still considered checked out in the working tree:

	$ git checkout -b work
	$ git bisect start HEAD HEAD~3
	... bisect detaches the current worktree ...
	$ git worktree add work
	Preparing worktree (checkout out 'work')
	fatal: 'work' is already checked out at ...

So, checking out back to the implicitly checked out branch sounds like it
should not fail.  And should be pretty secure (under the risk accepted by the
user) because we do not allow to normally check out the branch in another
worktree.  We even reject the checkout in the current worktree while bisecting,
but let's leave that for another time.

Note that due to the bug, what we are changing here is the reset on "second
worktrees".  That means, "bisect reset" on the main worktree has been allowed
for some time, we are just making it official.

And this is the less disrupting change in the usage.  Which does not justify
the change but does support it.

This is the reasoning I had and what makes me think that "checking out may
fail" is an inconvenience for the user, without any gain.

Now, if these arguments are reasonable, the next issue is what and how to
allow.  I chose at least strict, but maybe we can do something more
elaborate... just NULL sounds good.
