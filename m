The latter half of the first sentence feels a bit awkward, primarily
it sounds as if it almost wants to hint that it is good if we
connected these commits to some ref automatically, and it is far
from obvious why it is a good idea.  Perhaps

    ... the user can create some commits on detached HEAD, that are
    not connected to any ref.  If the user hasn't pointed at these
    commits by refs before removing the worktree, those commits will
    become unreachable.

That would be in line with the comment you moved in 1/3 that
describes why orphaned_commit_warning() helper is there, i.e.

    /*
     * We are about to leave commit that was at the tip of a detached
     * HEAD.  If it is not reachable from any ref, this is the last chance
     * for the user to do so without resorting to reflog.
     */

Good idea.  "Let's issue" -> "Issue" (or "Give", "Show").

Yes, it is absolutely necessary to adjust the message if you are to
reuse the orphaned_commit_warning() helper so that it matches the
situation as the end-user experiences.

The magic number "1" looks iffy.

Asterisk sticks to the variable, not to type, in C.  If you write

	struct commit *pointer, structure;

it is clear only one is the pointer.  It misleads people if you wrote

	struct commit* one, two;

instead.

> +									  &wt->head_oid, 1);

Also, lines around here look overly long.  Would it help to fold the
line after the initialization assignment, i.e.

		struct commit *wt_commit =
			lookup_commit_reference_gently(the_repository, ...);


> +		if (wt_commit)

Again, the magic number "0" looks iffy.

Can we think of a single way to phrase this batter?  It's not like
the reason why the user wants to save the orphaned history is
because it was at the PREVIOUS HEAD, or at the HEAD of a now-lost
working tree.  It is because the history leading to that commit is
now about to be lost.  So perhaps "history leading to commit X has
become unreachable" or something would apply to both situation and
we do not have to pass the mysterious "0"/"1" that are hardcoded?

If the situation were the opposite and there were many ways that
lead to lost history (i.e. not just the original "switch out of the
detached HEAD", we are now adding "discarding a worktree with HEAD
detached", and there may be more cases added in the future) that
need to be described differently, I would have instead suggested to
use an enum and use different phrasing for each case, but it does
not seem that the original "Previous HEAD position was" is so
superbly phrased that we do not want to lose it, and the second one
being added in the above hunk is not all that different.  If we can
get away with just a single universal message, it would make things
simpler.
