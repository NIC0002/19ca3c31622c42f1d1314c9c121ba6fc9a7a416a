This will cause some mild hardships, as later patches will need to
#define UNUSED in other spots, as well, in order to get full coverage of
the code base (I have written those annotation patches, but they're not
applied upstream yet).

Still, I tend to agree with you that we should handle this case. It's
not too much work, and I should be able to work around the multiple
definitions by pulling it out into an unused.h or similar.
