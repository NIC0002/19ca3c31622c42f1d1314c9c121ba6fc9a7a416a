Will fix or optimize.

That's because the "-C" option, it will not do stripspace for the
whole note, but support to use together with "-m" or "-F"(they will
do stripspace). So, for the consistent result with backforward
compatibility, we have to get the information about whether to do
stripspace when concating each message.

In the previous patch, I actually followed your suggestion to only
stripspace message itself but not the whole concatenate message. But
actually, there's a problem with this, in fact it's also caused by
"-C", "-C" doesn't stripspace, means that when mixed with "-m" and
"-F", the order of the options matters.

I'm not sure if this is a design flaw or if it's intentional, but
it's special about the stripspace handling of "-C" right now, which
is why I've added two new test cases in [3/6], just to make sure my
subsequent patches don't break them:

    * 'add notes with "-C" and "-m", "-m" will stripspace all together'

    * 'add notes with "-m" and "-C", "-C" will not stripspace all together'

I agree, but this seems to break the effect of "the order matters" because of
the "-C" argument. 

If we think that the "-C" particularity is a case that should be optimized or
fixed(), then I strongly agree with this modification approach, and I think
that compared to this particularity, on the one hand, our implementation
is simple, on the other hand, users may find it easier to understand.

I think this approach is feasible, and add judgment logic when supporting
subsequent --[no-] stripspaces.

The strbuf can record the "len" of the buf, to make sure the string
will be cut of if the content contains '\0' in the middle, like a binary
file. Maybe using a string could make that, but Iâ€˜m not sure how to solve
it.

I will add some test cases about it and found it out.

Thanks.
