Note to Junio: 8/8 (which renames "cs" -> "set") conflicts with
ab/config-multi-and-nonbool. I previously said that I'd rebase this, but
presumably a remerge-diff is more ergonomic + flexible (let me know if I'm
mistaken), so I'll send a remerge-diff in a reply (I don't trust GGG not to
mangle the patch :/).

After sending this out, I'll see if cocci can make it easy enough to change
config_fn_t. If so, I'll probably go with that approach for the future
'libified' patches, which should also line up nicely with what Ã†var
suggested.

= Changes in v3

 * Adjust the *_push() function to be unconditional (like the *_pop()
   function)

 * Various commit message and comment cleanups

= Changes in v2

 * To reduce churn, don't rename "struct config_source cf" to "cs" early in
   the series. Instead, rename the global "cf" to "cf_global", and leave the
   existing "cf"s untouched.
   
   Introduce 8/8 to get rid of the confusing acronym "struct config_source
   cf", but I don't mind ejecting it if it's too much churn.

 * Adjust 5/8 so to pass "struct config_reader" through args instead of
   "*data". v1 made the mistake of thinking "*data" was being passed to a
   callback, but it wasn't.

 * Add a 7/8 to fix a bug in die_bad_number(). I included this because it
   overlaps a little bit with the refactor here, but I don't mind ejecting
   this either.

 * Assorted BUG() message clarifications.

= Description

This series prepares for config.[ch] to be libified as as part of the
libification effort that Emily described in [1]. One of the first goals is
to read config from a file, but the trouble with how config.c is written
today is that all reading operations rely on global state, so before turning
that into a library, we'd want to make that state non-global.

This series doesn't remove all of the global state, but it gets us closer to
that goal by extracting the global config reading state into "struct
config_reader" and plumbing it through the config reading machinery. This
makes it possible to reuse the config machinery without global state, and to
enforce some constraints on "struct config_reader", which makes it more
predictable and easier to remove in the long run.

This process is very similar to how we've plumbed "struct repository" and
other 'context objects' in the past, except:

 * The global state (named "the_reader") for the git process lives in a
   config.c static variable, and not on "the_repository". See 3/6 for the
   rationale.

 * I've stopped short of adding "struct config_reader" to config.h public
   functions, since that would affect non-config.c callers.

Additionally, I've included a bugfix for die_bad_number() that became clear
as I did this refactor.

= Leftover bits

We still need a global "the_reader" because config callbacks are reading
auxiliary information about the config (e.g. line number, file name) via
global functions (e.g. current_config_line(), current_config_name()). This
is either because the callback uses this info directly (like
builtin/config.c printing the filename and scope of the value) or for error
reporting (like git_parse_int() reporting the filename of the value it
failed to parse).

If we had a way to plumb the state from "struct config_reader" to the config
callback functions, we could initialize "struct config_reader" in the config
machinery whenever we read config (instead of asking the caller to
initialize "struct config_reader" themselves), and config reading could
become a thread-safe operation. There isn't an obvious way to plumb this
state to config callbacks without adding an additional arg to config_fn_t
and incurring a lot of churn, but if we start replacing "config_fn_t" with
the configset API (which we've independently wanted for some time), this may
become feasible.

And if we do this, "struct config_reader" itself will probably become
obsolete, because we'd be able to plumb only the relevant state for the
current operation, e.g. if we are parsing a config file, we'd pass only the
config file parsing state, instead of "struct config_reader", which also
contains config set iterating state. In such a scenario, we'd probably want
to pass "struct key_value_info" to the config callback, since that's all the
callback should be interested in anyway. Interestingly, this was proposed by
Junio back in [2], and we didn't do this back then out of concern for the
churn (just like in v1).
