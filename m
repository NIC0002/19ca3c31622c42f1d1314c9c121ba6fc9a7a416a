Perhpas the expression should be "[\xc4\x80-\xf7\xbf\xbf\xbf]+", i.e.,
sequences of code points U+0080 to U+10FFFF?

This is not equivalent. The original treated a sequence of non-ASCII
characters as a word. The new version treats each individual non-space
character (both ASCII and non-ASCII) as a word.

This is acceptable, of course. The replacement range looks sensible.
