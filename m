Thank you for filling out a Git bug report!
Please answer the following questions to help us understand your issue.

What did you do before the bug happened? (Steps to reproduce your issue)

Issued git format-patch -M master -o patches/ --cover-letter inside a
given repository (hereafter "current repository").

What did you expect to happen? (Expected behavior)

The cover letter should have tallied my commits and associate them with
the current repository's user.name value.

What happened instead? (Actual behavior)

The cover letter follows my active mailmap and applies it when tallying
the commits. There is no way to tell it not to.

What's different between what you expected and what actually happened?

git format-patch is not consistent in applying authorship values. The
cover letter uses user.* to construct the From: line, which is correct;
but the authorship stats instead follow the mailmap.

Anything else you want to add:

To reproduce, set in your global .mailmap an entry remapping the
current repository's user.email value to a different author name than what is
stored in the repository's user.name. Then issue the git format-patch
line as described above.

Please review the rest of the bug report below.
You can delete any lines you don't wish to share.
