If that is what you are aiming at, I suspect that the posted patch
is doing it in a wrong way.  Instead, we should just declare that
the branch being bisected does not mean the branch cannot be checked
out elsewhere, so that

	$ git worktree add --detach ../another HEAD^0
	$ git checkout -b work
	$ git bisect start work work~3
        ... detaches ...
	$ git -C ../another checkout work

should just work, no?

I admit I haven't thought things through, but I tend to be
sympathetic to such a declaration.  After all, "bisect" is a
read-only operation as far as the branch you happened to be on when
you started a bisect session is concerned.  Jumping around and
materializing tree states recorded in various commits leading to the
tip of the branch and inspecting them would not change anything on
the branch itself.  And more importantly, the branch being checked
out in another worktree and modified there should not break the
bisection, EXCEPT that the final "git bisect reset" (without
arguments) would fail if the other worktree removed the branch.

So, how about removing the is_worktree_being_bisected() check from
find_shared_symref(), so that not just "worktree add" and "bisect
reset", but "checkout" and "switch" are allowed to make the branch
current even it is being bisected elsewhere?

That would affect the other topic, I suspect, as well.  It may be a
positive change.  Or are there cases I missed, where the branch
being bisected should not be touched from elsewhere, and we cannot
remove the check from find_shared_symref()?

Thanks.
