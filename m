Thinking of this as a whole, perhaps after this series we can add:

Subject: [PATCH] branch: copy_or_rename_branch() unconditionally calls

In previous commits we have introduced changes to
copy_or_rename_branch() that lead to unconditionally calling
ref_exists(), twice in some circumstances.

Optimize copy_or_rename_branch() so that it only calls ref_exists() once
and reorder some conditionals to consider ref_exists() first and avoid
unnecessarily calling other expensive functions.

Yes.  We did not have a test for 'No branch named' that implied an
orphan branch.  I think if we had tried that, we would have ended
up doing what we're doing now.

Considering 1/2 and 2/2, I think so. But if you're asking maybe
you're realizing something...
