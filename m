Hi Michael,

You clearly don't see what this is about! Only if the same CRC mechanism 
is end-to-end, you don't have any good integrity mechanism at all!

Let me try to explain what this is about in very simple words. Because 
memcpy() does not copy the ECC CRC values along with the data, it is an 
unsafe memory copy mechanism, which may introduce bit-errors without 
noticing. It does not help to only have ECC RAM or for that sake protect 
the PCI links.
