Thanks for this suggestion, Peff. What I like about this is that it builds off
of the existing diff.<driver> scheme rather than inventing another one.
Additionally, we won't get hit with a performance penalty since we already read
gitattrbitues to see if a driver has been set or not.

Thinking out loud, if we add "algorithm" as a key for diff.<driver>, it would be
mutually exclusive with "command" where "command" takes precedence, correct?
