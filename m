/etc/sudoers is not standard although usual. This path should come from a knob somewhere. We can't run this test on our x86 system anyway - no access to root or sudo even though it is installed. Also, /etc/sudoers is typically secured 0600 so the grep will fail even if is_root passes - and I'm worried about the portability of is_root, which is mostly Linux.
