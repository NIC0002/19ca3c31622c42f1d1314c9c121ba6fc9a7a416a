Right, to the callers it is no different; they must use the flags or the
struct fields. What I meant is that we do not need to support _both_.
I.e., the big mapping in run_command_v_opt_cd_env_tr2() goes away.

Yeah. I do not find RUN_GIT_CMD all that bad myself; I was mainly
pointing out that we do not need to support both of them (and of the
two, the struct fields are by far the more flexible, so that's what we
should keep).

That said, I am not too sad to have both. I would not have bothered to
do the work to remove the _v() versions with flags. But since Ren√©
already did so...
