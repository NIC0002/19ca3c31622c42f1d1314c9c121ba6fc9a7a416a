That question hadn't come across in the previous emails.

That "is fairly clear" is probably the problem. In retrospect it's not
clear in the docs that the "%<(N" format is (would appear to be) about
defining the display width, in terminal character columns, that the
selected parameter is to be displayed within.

The code already pads the displayed parameter with spaces as required if
the parameter is shorter than the display width - the else condition in
pretty.c L1750

The existing choice is padding "[][]" with a single space to reach 5
display chars.
For the 6-char "[][][]" truncation it is "[][..", i.e. 3 chars from
"[][][]", then the two ".." dots of the ellipsis.

Given the existing code and the display column expectation, it felt
rather simple to apply the hard cut at the display width, or pad with
spaces if the chars to display were shorter than the allocated columns.

A careful read (and testing) of the existing 'mtrunc' does show a
rounding error bug though. Its a confusion between the computed start
and end points of the cut that loses one display column (the string
displayed is short by one when the count is odd, IIUC).

The existing tests already cover the trailing space padding issues.
However I'd agree that the documentation (and original commit messages
for the existing code) do not make clear the distinction between display
columns to be filled and characters in the displayed parameters (aka
'placeholders').

Within that, there is also the "%<(N" and "%<|(M" lack of clarity, where
the N count is for a single place holder's character count, while the M
value is the terminal's display column number, of the 24x80 column style.

Finally, the docs use of '<N>'Â  in the middle the place holders title
that also use `<` and `>` is a readability nightmare. Given that the
text then only talks about `N` it may be sensible to drop the
surrounding `<.>` to reduce confusion for these alignment placeholders.
