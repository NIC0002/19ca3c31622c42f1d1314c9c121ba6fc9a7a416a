Well, the concrete use-case I'm exploring is something along the lines
of using the content hashes of sparse checkouts as cache keys for resource
heavy jobs (builds/tests/etc).

So, that would be something along the lines of,

     git ls-tree -r --paths-matching-sparsity-file=<pattern-file> \
     | sha1sum > cache-key

and then performing a lookup before performing an action (which would
then only be done in the context of the sparse checkout). My thinking
is that this only would require git and no additional tooling, which in
turn makes it very easy to reproduce the state where the job took place.

I don't think it necessarily would be better handled by that. But it would
be workable. It would be a matter of collating the output of

   git ls-tree -r <commit>

with

   git ls-tree --name-only -r <commit> | git check-ignore ...

Which is less ergonomic. But it is also a less intrusive change.

Really, the main thing is to expose the sparse filtering logic somehow, and
allow for building tooling on top of it.

I think you are the better judge of how much of a can of worms that would
be. I don't think it would be too out of line with how git acts in general
though, as we have things like the the 'GIT_INDEX_FILE' env-var.

Fair. Will do.

Yeah. After sleeping on it, I also think that it becomes a difficult
interface to work with, and you'll get different results with the same
patterns whether you pass --cone or --no-cone, which seems error prone
to me.

For better or for worse, both cone and non-cone uses of sparse-checkouts
end up producing pattern files. And those pattern files do unambiguously
describe a filtering of the worktree whether it is in cone-mode or not.

Given that 'ls-tree' is more of a plumbing command, I think it might still
make sense to use the patterns. That would also make the interaction
a bit more logical to me -- e.g. if you want to override the patterns
you have to pass them in the same format as the ones that would be read
by default.

Then maybe it could eventually make sense to expose the translation of
cone-mode patterns as well, e.g.

    git sparse-checkout set --cone --std-out dir1 dir2 dir3

or similar.
