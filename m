Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <git.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: git@vger.kernel.org

NOTE: Rebased on master, yet again, because (1) Junio merged his commit to
master separately, and (2) Ã†var's intentional duplication of my second
patch[1] later conflicted with other changes I had to make in the same area.
(Which isn't a big deal, but for future reference, it would be nicer to
avoid conflicts by omitting the fixup I had already submitted[2] instead of
intentionally duplicating it).

This started as a simple series to fix restore_state() in builtin/merge.c,
fixing an issue reported by ZheNing Hu[3]. It's grown so much it's hard to
call it simple. Anyway...

Changes since v2:

 * Removed the first two patches, as noted above in the comment about
   rebasing.
 * Inserted new patches 3, 4, and 5 to fix some related bugs. Folks are more
   likely to object to patch 5 than the others; people should probably take
   a look at that one if they have limited time.
 * Dramatically reworded commit messages given the misunderstandings of what
   was being addressed and done. Hopefully it is much clearer what the last
   three patches are doing and what they are not doing, and why.
 * Added several new testcases

          merge: make restore_state() restore staged state too
      
     -    merge can be invoked with uncommitted changes, including staged changes.
     -    merge is responsible for restoring this state if some of the merge
     -    strategies make changes.  However, it was not restoring staged changes
     -    due to the lack of the "--index" option to "git stash apply".  Add the
     -    option to fix this shortcoming.
     +    There are multiple issues at play here:
     +
     +      1) If `git merge` is invoked with staged changes, it should abort
     +         without doing any merging, and the user's working tree and index
     +         should be the same as before merge was invoked.
     +      2) Merge strategies are responsible for enforcing the index == HEAD
     +         requirement. (See 9822175d2b ("Ensure index matches head before
     +         invoking merge machinery, round N", 2019-08-17) for some history
     +         around this.)
     +      3) Merge strategies can bail saying they are not an appropriate
     +         handler for the merge in question (possibly allowing other
     +         strategies to be used instead).
     +      4) Merge strategies can make changes to the index and working tree,
     +         and have no expectation to clean up after themselves, *even* if
     +         they bail out and say they are not an appropriate handler for
     +         the merge in question.  (The `octopus` merge strategy does this,
     +         for example.)
     +      5) Because of (3) and (4), builtin/merge.c stashes state before
     +         trying merge strategies and restores it afterward.
     +
     +    Unfortunately, if users had staged changes before calling `git merge`,
     +    builtin/merge.c could do the following:
     +
     +    Â  Â * stash the changes, in order to clean up after the strategies
     +    Â  Â * try all the merge strategies in turn, each of which report they
     +         cannot function due to the index not matching HEAD
     +    Â  Â * restore the changes via "git stash apply"
     +
     +    But that last step would have the net effect of unstaging the user's
     +    changes.  Fix this by adding the "--index" option to "git stash apply".
     +    While at it, also squelch the stash apply output; we already report
     +    "Rewinding the tree to pristine..." and don't need a detailed `git
     +    status` report afterwards.

          merge: ensure we can actually restore pre-merge state
      
     -    Merge strategies can fail -- not just have conflicts, but give up and
     -    say that they are unable to handle the current type of merge.  However,
     -    they can also make changes to the index and working tree before giving
     -    up; merge-octopus does this, for example.  Currently, we do not expect
     -    the individual strategies to clean up after themselves, but instead
     -    expect builtin/merge.c to do so.  For it to be able to, it needs to save
     -    the state before trying the merge strategy so it can have something to
     -    restore to.  Therefore, remove the shortcut bypassing the save_state()
     -    call.
     +    Merge strategies can:
     +      * succeed with a clean merge
     +      * succeed with a conflicted merge
     +      * fail to handle the given type of merge
     +
     +    If one is thinking in terms of automatic mergeability, they would use
     +    the word "fail" instead of "succeed" for the second bullet, but I am
     +    focusing here on ability of the merge strategy to handle the given
     +    inputs, not on whether the given inputs are mergeable.  The third
     +    category is about the merge strategy failing to know how to handle the
     +    given data; examples include:
     +
     +      * Passing more than 2 branches to 'recursive' or 'ort'
     +      * Passing 2 or fewer branches to 'octopus'
     +      * Trying to do more complicated merges with 'resolve' (I believe
     +        directory/file conflicts will cause it to bail.)
     +      * Octopus running into a merge conflict for any branch OTHER than
     +        the final one (see the "exit 2" codepath of commit 98efc8f3d8
     +        ("octopus: allow manual resolve on the last round.", 2006-01-13))
     +
     +    That final one is particularly interesting, because it shows that the
     +    merge strategy can muck with the index and working tree, and THEN bail
     +    and say "sorry, this strategy cannot handle this type of merge; use
     +    something else".
     +
     +    Further, we do not currently expect the individual strategies to clean
     +    up after themselves, but instead expect builtin/merge.c to do so.  For
     +    it to be able to, it needs to save the state before trying the merge
     +    strategy so it can have something to restore to.  Therefore, remove the
     +    shortcut bypassing the save_state() call.
     +
     +    There is another bug on the restore_state() side of things, so no
     +    testcase will be added until the next commit when we have addressed that
     +    issue as well.
