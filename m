Dear Mr,


My name is Jerry Nicolas, 


Howâ€™s your day going?
Please I would like to introduce you to the organization I work 
for.
They are an organization based in Qatar and are interested in 
debt financing in form of loans at 3% ROI annually for 5 to 15 
years. 
If you have a project that is in need of funding please let me 
know.

It will be a pleasure to cooperate with you if you ever need a 
loan or can make referrals for free.  

Have a nice day. 

Jerry Niocolas.
