You mentioned in another reply that you figured it out, but for the sake
of anyone reading here: we _add_ a repo-scoped version for the config,
but we need this globally-scoped one for process-wide disabling the
feature. This could be said more clearly.

Generally, I decided to move it after option-parsing, so it wouldn't
be called if we are hitting an option-parse error.

However, these moves were only important for a draft version where
I had not separated the global and local scopes, so calling the method
would also load config.

In this version of the patch, this is not needed at all, and I could
do an in-line replacement. Thanks!

Thanks. This is a leftover from a previous version of the patch.

Thank you for pointing them out, as the things that brought you
confusion are cruft from an earlier version but are no longer
valuable in this version.

Thanks,
