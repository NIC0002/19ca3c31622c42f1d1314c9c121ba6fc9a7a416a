Makes sense.

Since most callers just call "format += len", it kind of feels like the
appropriate interface might be more like:

  strbuf_expand_literal(&sb, &format);

to auto-advance the format. But I guess that gets weird with this
caller:

which is still in the "return the length" mentality (OTOH, if it
advanced the local copy of the placeholder pointer nobody would mind).

I dunno. It is a little thing, and I am OK with it either way (I would
not even think of changing it if you were not already touching the
function).
