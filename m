It's not clear from this description whether the pathnames of the
patches are fed to the hook on stdin or if the patch contents are fed
on stdin.

This does a better job than the commit message of explaining that
stdin receives the names of the patches rather than the content of the
patches themselves. It's a nit, but it might be even clearer to say
that <patch-file> is the _pathname_ of the file rather than merely the
_name_.

It was a bit startling to see this spelled "e-mail" rather than
"email", the latter of which is used far more frequently in the
documentation. However, "e-mail" does indeed appear in githooks.txt
more frequently than "email", so the use of "e-mail" here is probably
fine.

I doubt that any of the above comments warrant a reroll.
