I think my issue may be that I do not have a complete set of patches. The tests I ran did not produce output like that. This also may be something to clarify in the documentation - can you post the latest bit?

As a user of this, what I was looking for was some way to query the inventory of relevant hooks. Assuming the user knows where all the possible hooks are, I guess this is ok.

I think the useful case is more sharing hooks between copies of the repo, not sharing hooks between repos of different origins. So ~/.gitconfig is not the place I am likely to put hooks. It's not like I have 50-100 different projects on the fly at once üòâ

Isn't that in √Üvar series? I don't see it in 2.35.1? I don't think the goal is scripting around git, it is more scripting inside git. The users with whom I work seem to want the least amount of external scripting as possible, mostly because of how they are running git. The model I am working work, which is multi-platform (and not shell-invoked), is to set up a fa√ßade that runs git to perform whatever needs to be done, and the hooks offer some good value because we are inside a shell by that point, but not when git gets launched. I know it's funky, but that's why I find the whole series "interesting".
