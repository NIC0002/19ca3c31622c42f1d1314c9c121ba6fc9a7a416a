If one has a plan in place for a series in preparation, I'd want to
prepare the outline of the cover letter first, and then later let it
float to the tip of the series after a rebase, and incorporate (meld)
additional notelets recorded as additional empty commits.

On thought is to marry this with the `rebase --autosquash` mechanism
that will rearrange commits (when enabled) so that we could have a
"branchtip! " subject line, similar to the `fixup! / squash!` subject
lines to assist in that rearrangementÂ  of the series for transmission.

I'm not yet sure how the "branchtip" method would work with Pull
Requests and the idea of actually having a push/pull exchangeable branch
description - there's been a very recent discussion on the Git-user list
[1] which started from a slightly different premise, but maybe has some
of the same issues as persistent Change-ID's [2].
