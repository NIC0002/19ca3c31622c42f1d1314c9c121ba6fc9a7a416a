Abhradeep started working on a prototype to teach Git how to read and
write Roaring+Run bitmaps in this series:

  https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.1357.git.1663609659.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/

Some folks gave it a review, but there wasn't any serious traction and I
don't think that Abhradeep has had a chance to come back to the series.

For what it's worth, I would love if Abhradeep (or anybody else
interested in working on this area) picked it back up, either using that
series as a starting point or going from scratch.

I don't have the capacity to mentor a student this cycle, and I am
probably the most interested among potential mentors in seeing this
project through ;-).

I don't think that it's too small (in fact, it was probably an error on
my part to include this as a potential stretch goal in Abhradeep's
project). We don't have any evidence that it's a good or bad idea.

Abhradeep promised[1] that he'd include some performance work in his
next version of that series. I think the main things we'd be interested
in are:

  - Does using Roaring provide a file-size advantage over
    EWAH-compressed bitmaps?
  - Does Roaring make it faster to inflate bitmaps? To deflate them?

Deflating bitmaps doesn't matter as much, IMHO, since that is a cost
that we pay only when we first have to compress bitmaps before writing
them. But if we could significantly reduce the inflation cost, that
would be an advantage to using Roaring+Run bitmaps over EWAH ones since
they would be faster to decompress at read-time.

Thanks,
Taylor
