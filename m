Dear git,

I am Mustafa Ayvaz, a personal attorney to the late Mr. Robert,=20
who lost his life due to Coronavirus disease, which he contracted=20
during his business trip in China. I contacted you to work with=20
me in securing the transfer of a fund: Four million four hundred=20
and twenty thousand dollars, legacy left by him.

I have thoroughly searched for the next of kin to my deceased=20
client, but have failed as I do not have his current residence=20
and contact details. As I was searching, I bumped into your=20
profile having the same last name and in the same locality with=20
the next of kin. I decided to contact you and use you as the=20
Bonafide next of kin.

I solicit your consent to produce you as the next of kin to my=20
deceased client since both of you bear the same last name. The=20
funds will then be transferred to you as the beneficiary and=20
shared according to a proposed sharing pattern / ratio of 60:40=20
i.e. 60% for me and 40% for you. For more details kindly contact=20
me immediately for more information. 

After which I will send you the details of how the transaction=20
will commence, Contact me back for more information through my=20
email address.

Regards
Mustafa Ayvaz
