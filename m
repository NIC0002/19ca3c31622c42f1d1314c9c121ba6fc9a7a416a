> Please remain on the topic. Read my initial sentence again. What has "tagged" to do with related? And even if, the amount of 146,090 "tagged" questions is absolute madness. This is insane. Just look at the ratio in comparison to Python, a programming language. It is crazy to assume that this is fine and only proves my point. No, Git is not a complex programming language like Python, nor is it a Kernel API. It is supposed to be a user-facing tool made for humans.

The purpose of Git is to provide a Source Code Management system for
Linux. Linux development is *distributed*, and Linux is command line
orientated.

The need for a distributed SCM required a significant shift in mind set
compared to previous *control* systems that were historically based on
drawing and physical part management systems [1].
Â 
The ability to 'manufacture' duplicate copies of code, and then modify
them, at speed, makes those historical methods essentially impractical /
unworkable. Hence Git, with all it's foibles, has been widely adopted,
as control now lies with the user. Management can still be responsible
for 'authentication/designation' of specific revisions.

Git generally offers two world views, one that roughly matches the old
'change control' methods (diffs), and true 'local state' view. It is
easy to miss the subtle shift in world views.

Junio is not a "product manager". He is not 'selling' to the wider user
base. He is maintaining a core element of the Linux ecosystem. I doubt
it's an easy job, balancing backward compatibility, future capability,
and broad usability, along with code quality, security and all the rest.

Learning Git is like learning Quantum Mechanics, it's just a few simple
rules, but the mind set shift is difficult. It has action at a distance,
and is amazingly effective.

In many ways it's the confusion between 'developer' facing, and 'user'
facing tooling. The nuances are different.
