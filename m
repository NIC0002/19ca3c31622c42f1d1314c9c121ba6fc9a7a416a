I have another reluctant suggestion, but it depends on your industry, regulations, and other factors. In some sectors, there is a requirement to keep only some period of time worth of history. In fact, in some settings, keeping user identifying information beyond, say 7 years, actually is problematic. Pruning your history may be not only an option but required. An alternative is to use filter-branch to essentially tokenize the identities of past authors and keep those in a electronic vault somewhere. I have customers who are interpreting GDPR-like rules just such as situation, where employees gone 7 years ago and cannot be retained, by name, in the repos. I am not personally happy about that, because my own repo-OCD demands that I know exactly who did what until the end of time, but according to them, it actually violates the local regulations. I'm sure you have had conversations with lawyers, yes? â˜¹
