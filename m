And here's a re-roll.

As before, I think the first patch is the most important, and the rest
are optimizations. But with Eric's patch to chainlint.pl in the middle,
I think the argument for patch 4 (previously patch 3) is much stronger.

Patch 5 remains mostly a cleanup, with no performance improvement. IMHO
the result is easier to follow, but I'm open to arguments to the
contrary.

         The tradeoff in safety was undoubtedly worth it when 99a64e4b73c was
    -    written. But these days, the external chainlint.pl does a pretty good
    -    job of finding these (even though it's not something it specifically
    -    tries to flag). For example, if you have a test like:
    -
    -            test_expect_success 'should fail linter' '
    -                    some_command >actual &&
    -                    cat >expect <<-\EOF &&
    -                    ok
    -                    # missing EOF line here
    -                    test_cmp expect actual
    -            '
    -
    -    it will see that the here-doc isn't closed, treat it as not-a-here-doc,
    -    and complain that the "ok" line does not have an "&&". So in practice we
    -    should be catching these via that linter, although:
    -
    -      - the error message is not as good as it could be (the real problem is
    -        the unclosed here-doc)
    -
    -      - it can be fooled if there are no lines in the here-doc:
    -
    -          cat >expect <<-\EOF &&
    -          # missing EOF line here
    -
    -        or if every line in the here-doc has &&-chaining (weird, but
    -        possible)
    -
    -    Those are sufficiently unlikely that they're not worth worrying too much
    -    about. And by switching back to a simpler chain-lint, hyperfine reports
    -    a measurable speedup on t3070 (which has 1800 tests):
