Yeah, I'm happy to drop this whole thing. I do think it would be
reasonable for fsck to check for overflow alongside BAD_FILEMODE, etc,
but it's annoying to do since we are relying on the existing parser.

I actually have a suspicion that it might be reasonable for fsck to just
parse the trees itself, rather than relying on decode_tree_entry(), etc.
But that's a much bigger topic (and a possible maintenance burden) for
questionable gain, so unless we find some compelling reason (some case
that we really want to detect but which we want the regular decoder to
ignore), it's probably not worth exploring.
