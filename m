"cherry-pick --abort" uses "reset --merge" so is slightly more 
complicated than just resetting the index.

Indeed, being able to cherry-pick when the worktree is dirty is 
occasionally useful but it is confusing when "cherry-pick --abort" does 
not restore the pre-cherry-pick state (and as Junio says below it would 
be complicated to preserve the initial changes when aborting).

I think so though I'm not sure what what "--quit" does to CHERRY_PICK_HEAD.

I think it's worth considering a config option. One problem though is 
that if the user has to actively enable it to get greater safety it wont 
be much help to new users who don't know about it and if it is on by 
default we'll be breaking someone's existing workflow.
