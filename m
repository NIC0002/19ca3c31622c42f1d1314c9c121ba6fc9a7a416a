Subject: [PATCH 0/2] blame: Make --show-name negatable

With -s git blame does not show author and date, but will show the file name
if the file was renamed some time in the past. With -c git blame will
not show the name, even if the file was renamed, but will show author
and date.

Working with a code base that already uses long lines and has a deep
nested directory structure the output of git blame gets hard to read due
to line wrapping.

While looking for a solution on IRC a user was so nice to gave me a
patch (and permission to submit it) that allows to disable showing of
the file name even if the file was renamed. This allows to show only the
commit id with `git blame -s --no-show-name`.

The second patch only adds this informations to the man page.
