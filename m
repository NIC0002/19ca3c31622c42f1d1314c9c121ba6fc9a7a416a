This invocation would likewise have a problem with gitlink entries (for
submodules). I think what you really want is not "exclude symlinks" but
"show only regular files". There is no option for that, but you can do
it by grepping modes from "-s", like:

  git ls-files -s | grep '^100[67]' | ...

You do unfortunately have to then pull the filename out of the rest of
the line, and since we didn't use "-z", it will be quoted (and using
"-z" makes it hard to use tools like grep and sed). A mild application
of perl works, though:

  git ls-files -s |
  perl -0ne 'print if s/^100(644|755).*?\t//' |
  xargs -0 ...

So I dunno. That is not exactly pretty, but if you were hiding it in a
"git sed" alias or script, it's not so bad.

If we were to add an option to ls-files, it would make more sense to me
to allow the user to include/exclude by mode or possibly naming the type
(e.g., "f" for regular files, "l" for symbolic links, etc, which matches
"find"). And then allow inclusion/exclusion similar to the way that
git-diff's --diff-filter option works.
