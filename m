From: Julia Ramer <gitprplr@gmail.com>

With the recent turnover on the git-security list, questions came up how
things are usually run. Rather than answering questions individually,
extend Git's existing documentation about security vulnerabilities to
describe the git-security mailing list, how things are run on that list,
and what to expect throughout the process from the time a security bug
is reported all the way to the time when a fix is released.

-Abstract: When a critical vulnerability is discovered and fixed, we follow this
- script to coordinate a public release.
+Abstract: When a vulnerability is reported, we follow these guidelines to
+ assess the vulnerability, create and review a fix, and coordinate embargoed
+ security releases.
+
+The `git-security` mailing list
+===============================
+
+Responsible disclosures of vulnerabilities, analysis, proposed fixes as
+well as the orchestration of coordinated embargoed releases all happen on the
+`git-security` mailing list at <git-security@googlegroups.com>.
+
+In this context, the term "embargo" refers to the time period that information
+about a vulnerability is kept under wraps and only shared on a need-to-know
+basis. This is necessary to protect Git's users from bad actors who would
+otherwise be made aware of attack vectors that could be exploited. "Lifting the
+embargo" refers to publishing the version that fixes the vulnerabilities.
+
+Audience of the `git-security` mailing list
+-------------------------------------------
+
+Anybody may contact the `git-security` mailing list by sending an email
+to <git-security@googlegroups.com>, though the archive is closed to the
+public and only accessible to subscribed members.
+
+There are a few dozen subscribed members: core Git developers who are trusted
+with addressing vulnerabilities, and stakeholders (i.e. owners of products
+affected by security vulnerabilities in Git).
+
+Most of the discussions revolve around assessing the severity of the reported
+bugs (including the decision whether the report is security-relevant or can be
+redirected to the public mailing list), how to remediate the bug, determining
+the timeline of the disclosure as well as aligning priorities and
+requirements.
+
+Communications
+--------------
+
+If you are a stakeholder, it is a good idea to pay close attention to the
+discussions, as pertinent information may be buried in the middle of a lively
+conversation that might not look relevant to your interests. For example, the
+tentative timeline might be agreed upon in the middle of discussing code
+comment formatting in one of the patches and whether or not to combine fixes
+for multiple, separate vulnerabilities into the same embargoed release. Most
+mail threads are not usually structured specifically to communicate
+agreements, assessments or timelines.
+
+A bug's life: Typical timeline
+==============================
+
+- A bug is reported to the `git-security` mailing list.
+
+- Within a couple of days, someone from the core Git team responds with an
+  initial assessment of the bugâ€™s severity.
+
+- Other core developers - including the Git maintainer - chime in.
+
+- After discussion, if consensus is reached that the bug is not critical enough
+  to warrant any embargo, the reporter is redirected to the public Git mailing
+  list. This ends the reporter's interaction with the `git-security` list.
+
+- If the bug is critical enough for an embargo, ideas are presented on how to
+  address the vulnerability.
+
+- Usually around that time, the Git maintainer or their delegate(s) open a draft
+  security advisory in the `git/git` repository on GitHub (see below for more
+  details).
+
+- Depending on the preferences of the involved contributors and reviewers, code
+  review then happens either on the `git-security` mailing list or in a private
+  fork associated with the draft security advisory.
+
+- Once the review has settled and everyone involved in the review agrees that
+  the patches are ready, the Git maintainer determines a release date as well
+  as the release trains that are serviced. The decision regarding which versions
+  need a backported fix is based on input from the reporter, the contributor who
+  worked on the patches, and from stakeholders (e.g. operators of hosting sites
+  who may want to analyze whether the given bug is exploited via any of the
+  repositories they host).
+
+- Subsequently, branches with the fixes are pushed to private repositories that
+  are owned by the Git project, with tightly controlled access.
+
+- The tags are created by the Git maintainer and pushed to the same
+  repositories.
+
+- Less than a week before the release, a mail with the relevant information is
+  sent to <distros@vs.openwall.org> (see below), a list used to pre-announce embargoed
+  releases of open source projects to the stakeholders of all major Linux
+  distributions. This includes a Git bundle of the tagged version(s), but no
+  further specifics of the vulnerability.
+
+- Public communication is then prepared in advance of the release date. This
+  includes blog posts and mails to the Git and Git for Windows mailing lists.
+
+- The Git for Windows maintainer prepares the corresponding release artifacts,
+  based on the tags created that have been prepared by the Git maintainer.
+
+- Git for Windows release artifacts are made available under embargo to
+  stakeholders via a mail to the `git-security` list.
+
+- On the day of the release, at around 10am Pacific Time, the Git maintainer
+  pushes the tag and the `master` branch to the public repository, then sends
+  out an announcement mail.
+
+- Once the tag is pushed, the Git for Windows maintainer publishes the
+  corresponding tag and creates a GitHub Release with the associated release
+  artifacts (Git for Windows installer, Portable Git, MinGit, etc).
+
+- Git for Windows release is then announced via a mail to the public Git and
+  Git for Windows mailing lists as well as via a tweet.
+
+- A mail to <oss-security@lists.openwall.org> (see below for details) is sent as a
+  follow-up to the <distros@vs.openwall.org> one, describing the vulnerability in
+  detail, often including a proof of concept of an exploit.
+
+Note: The Git project makes no guarantees about timelines, but aims to keep
+embargoes reasonably short in the interest of keeping Git's users safe.
 
 How we coordinate embargoed releases

-If the vulnerability affects the server side, or can benefit from scans on the
