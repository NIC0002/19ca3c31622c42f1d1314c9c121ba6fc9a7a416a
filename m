When I use the `git remote` command, I use the -vv variant to what what
I need, i.e. its more than `-v`, so maybe adding an extra
`--show-partial-filter` option may be necessary (with a more compact
name ;-).

There will also be a similar desire (IIUC) to match the sparse/cone mode
repos to their remotes, i.e. to remind a user that what is held at the
remote isn't the same as held locally.

I hear your pain here. I had the same issue with the branch description.
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15058844/print-branch-description).
It's the same 'extract from config' problem.
Â 
```You can display the branch description using a git config command.

To show all branch descriptions, I have the alias

brshow = config --get-regexp 'branch.*.description'

, and for the current HEAD I have

brshow1 = !git config --get "branch.$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref
HEAD).description". ```

so it is possible to generalise the config query, if hard to discover.
