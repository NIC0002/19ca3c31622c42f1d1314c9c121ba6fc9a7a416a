Oh, that's an interesting idea.  I think it could help other cases as
well, e.g. in case of an alias like 'pg = push github', after 'git pg
<TAB>' the completion script would list remotes, but we'd actually
need refspecs.

I like the idea of inserting the expansion of git aliases into the
words array, as if they were present on the command line, and as far
as I can tell it's safe to do so, after all it's pretty much matches
what git itself does when expanding such an alias.  However, I'm
worried about doing the same for shell aliases, because those can
expand to just about anything, including e.g. some filtering pipe
stages after the aliased git command, that will be added to
$expanded_words, and could cause all kinds of confusion in various
completion functions.

Yeah, that should definitely be words[__git_cmd_idx]=...

As far as dispatching to the right _git_cmd() function, it doesn't
matter whether we overwrite the $words at index 1 or $__git_cmd_idx;
but for that we wouldn't have to overwrite words[1] at all.

However, there is (AFAIK only) one completion helper function
__git_complete_remote_or_refspec() which does what its name suggests,
but behaves slightly differently whether it's invoked for 'git push',
'pull', 'fetch', or 'remote'.  Alas, this function doesn't have a
parameter that its caller could use to tell how to behave, but it
decides what to do by looking at the word on the command line
containing the git command, i.e. ${words[__git_cmd_idx]}.  So I guess
with a simple alias like 'p = push' completing 'git -c var=val p
origin <TAB>' would misbehave, because that 'words[1]=...' would
overwrite '-c', so the completion function would see the words 'git
push var=val p origin', but inside __git_complete_remote_or_refspec()
that ${words[__git_cmd_idx]} would be 'p', and without seeing one of
the supported commands that function won't list refspecs.


One "dragon with more complicated aliases" might be that
__git_aliased_command() doesn't know about git's --options, in
particular which --options take a mandatory argument.  Yesterday I
learned that, quoting the description of 'alias.*' from git-config
manpage, "the first word of an alias does not necessarily have to be a
command.  It can be a command-line option that will be passed into the
invocation of git."  Now, if I understand you patch correctly, then it
would only add those words to $expansion_words that follow the aliased
command, e.g. with an alias like 'pg = -c var=val push github' when
completing 'git pg <TAB>', then $words would contain 'git push
github'.  On one hand this is good, because $__git_cmd_idx would index
the right element of the $words array even after inserting the
expansion of the alias.  OTOH, it can be bad, because with an alias
like 'pg = -C path push github' __git_aliased_command() would believe
that the command is "path", not "push".

Another dragon might be the support for recursive aliases: will the
order of words in $expansion_words match the order that git uses when
expanding aliases recursively?
