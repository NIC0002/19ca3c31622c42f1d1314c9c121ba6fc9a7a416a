I agree on this one.

(Edited out your explanation.)

I'm still not super convinced that this solves a common user problem,
but you've documented your use case well (in other places). The
problem I see is that the current patch brings it in without having
any of that context.

I think you're over-simplifying here, because...

I think one thing that might help bridge the divide here is a
different split when I think of "revision range" and "rev-list options".

We have several categories of rev-list options, and we need to find
the right set to care about and the ones that aren't useful for git-replay:

 1. (What I call revision ranges) a collection of starting revisions,
    each marked as an "include" or "exclude" (A..B includes B,
    excludes A). The --not option helps with defining these starting
    points.

 2. (Walk options) Modifications to how we walk commits, such as
    --first-parent, --ancestry-path. These are so far the kind of
    options you have motivated with use cases.

 3. (Ordering options) Modifications to how those commits are ordered,
    such as --topo-order, --date-order, and --reverse. These seem to
    be overridden by git-replay (although, --reverse probably causes
    some confusion right now).

 4. (Filtering options) A post-walk filter on a per-commit basis.
    This includes --(max|min)-parents, --author, --grep.

note: at this point I'm not sure into which of these categories we
should put time-based options like --since.

My main objection to the generic rev-list options come from allowing
categories (3) and (4), since this is more likely to cause user
confusion rather than actually be of any use to the feature.

While I was not considering (2) to be included in setup_revision_ranges(),
I could see it being valid to include both (1) and (2) in those options.

I would like to see tests for options in category (2) to demonstrate
these use cases and solidify them in our supported scenarios.

I'm trying to read the patches and make sense of what is written there.

The current patch especially is far too lightly documented for what
it is actually implementing.

Even its documentation states this:

+<revision-range>::
+	Range of commits to replay; see "Specifying Ranges" in
+	linkgit:git-rev-parse.

This "Specifying Ranges" section describes exactly category (1) of
what I was talking about, but really the patch enables everything
in "Commit Limiting" from git-rev-list.

Based on what I see in the patch, I can't help but think that the
extra options are an accident.

And _even with the extra context linked elsewhere_ I will still hold
that using something as generic as setup_revisions() isn't a good
practice for software development. It adds too may things that all
at once, some of which I don't think match the purpose of git-replay.
You've convinced me to expand my understanding of what fits in that
category, but I still think we need to test this more. Tests can
demonstrate use cases much better than anything else.

This investigation is exactly why I'm concerned about using the
generic setup_revisions(). I've already noticed its use elsewhere
and been disappointed. But I wasn't around when those were written,
so you get the short straw and become the reason I bring it up.

I think a better API is a great idea! Splitting into multiple methods
or providing option flags for "categories" of options allowed would
also work.

But back to my original suggestion: you can also do something simpler
for v1 of git-replay (say, very limited revision parsing such as one A..B
range) so your progress here isn't blocked on refactoring the revisions
API.
