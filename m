The book content is added to the sql database by a ruby job. But we
stopped running that job for the v1 (first-edition) book at some point
before 2017. I don't have an exact date, but I removed the generation
code in 495fa431 (drop book.rake, 2017-10-08). We later restored it so
that we could re-import historical versions (say, if the database
crashed and was wiped), but it finally went away in f474e35c (Remove
link to 1st book edition, 2018-11-21).

Frankly, I'm surprised there's any v1 content left, since we've had to
re-build the database from scratch a few times over the years.
