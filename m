Reading your email up to this point makes me think that we should ignore
any CR bytes we see next to a LF. So by this point I think that we
should take Ã†var's suggestion and call:

    strbuf_getwholeline(&buf, stdin, opt->nul_terminated ? '\0' : '\n');

But...

This makes me think that we should retain support for dropping the CR
preceeeding a LF and treat it as a historical wart that we are stuck
supporting.

Do you have a preference? I am fine with either approach, FWIW.

Thanks,
Taylor
