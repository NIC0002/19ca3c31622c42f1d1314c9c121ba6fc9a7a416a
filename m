Ok, I've trimmed your latest reply to focus on the main point:
"Why bundles?"

You are right that we could use a table of contents to list the
metadata that we need (that is currently stored in the bundle
header) except for one case: the single bundle. If the provider
wants to skip the table of contents/bundle list and only provide
one file that bootstraps clones, then we need something more than
just a packfile.

This could be remedied by _requiring_ the table of contents with
the ref list, but it does lead to separation of the packfile from
the important ref information.

Further, the provider might want to cover a large number of refs,
not just the default ref. That would increase the size of the
table of contents more than necessary.

With these things in mind, I do still think bundles are a good
way to store and share this data.

Thanks,
