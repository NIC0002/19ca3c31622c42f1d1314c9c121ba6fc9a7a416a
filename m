My understanding was the 'preserve' may not have retained the expected
history structure. `rebasing` merges is better with the history
expectations. Neither address the merge resolutions.

The rerere man page is still magic for me. The UX here could be
improved. (also, could the rerere-train be focussed on each merge?)

I believe there is a paper that highlights that even diff's aren't
unique. So I don't expect merges to be resolvable in the general case.
It's why we have software engineers;-)Â 

We also have to distinguish between interactive and automatic rebase,
and how much information could be provided to the user about the
previous merges (in the insn), and during resolution of a current merge
conflict compared to the prior conflict. The interactive rebase could
allow early resolution guidance from the users (e.g. highlighting likely
semantic conflicts which shouldn't be auto resolved, which to use
rerere, etc)
