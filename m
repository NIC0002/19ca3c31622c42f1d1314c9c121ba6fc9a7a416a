I'm no list regular anymore, but still a "next+ regular". While
experimenting with my own patch I noticed something got fixed
unexpectedly. That goes to show that these unexpected successes
(from expect_failure) go unnoticed too easily. I had missed this on my
regular rebuilds.

That's why I mentioned "no list regular" - I didn't know about that knob
nor the intention to have the test suite run with either implementation
(rather than switching to the new one for good).

I do local builds, usually with

```
DEVELOPER=1 (which I had to disable during the bisect run; gcc12...)
DEFAULT_TEST_TARGET=prove
GIT_PROVE_OPTS=--jobs 4
GIT_TEST_OPTS=--root=/dev/shm/t --chain-lint
SHELL_PATH=/bin/dash
SKIP_DASHED_BUILT_INS=y
```

in config.mak. Nothing else strikes me as potentially relevant.

Ã†var noticed this and has a better version of my patch, I think.

Michael
