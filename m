My goal was to explain that "huh" with this bit in the commit message:

without going into too many details. I do think it would be easier to
explain if the Windows implementation was added in the same commit
(since it is explicitly just about pipes), but I wanted to credit Ren√©
as the author there. I'm not sure if it's worth folding them together
and adding a co-author credit instead. Or maybe I should state outright
in this commit message that we're doing it for Windows. ;)
