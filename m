And here's a re-roll based on feedback on v1. Poor Jan; I hope this
thread isn't blowing up your inbox. :) But thank you for reporting the
problem!

The changes from v1 are:

  - clarified rationale in patch 2
  - new patch 3 improves an error message and reduces scope of fname_old
  - patch 4 cleans up fname_old to use tempfile path

Range diff is below.

  [1/5]: repack: convert "names" util bitfield to array
  [2/5]: repack: populate extension bits incrementally
  [3/5]: repack: expand error message for missing pack files
  [4/5]: repack: use tempfiles for signal cleanup
  [5/5]: repack: drop remove_temporary_files()

    -    There are two small problems with this:
    +    There's one small problem with this. In repack_promisor_objects(), we
    +    may add entries to "names" and call populate_pack_exts() for them.
    +    Calling it again is mostly just wasteful, as we'll stat() the filename
    +    with each possible extension, get the same result, and just overwrite
    +    our bits.
     
    -      - repack_promisor_objects() may have added entries to "names", and
    -        already called populate_pack_exts() for them. This is mostly just
    -        wasteful, as we'll stat() the filename with each possible extension,
    -        get the same result, and just overwrite our bits. But it makes the
    -        code flow confusing, and it will become a problem if we try to make
    -        populate_pack_exts() do more things.
    +    So we could drop the call there, and leave the final loop to populate
    +    all of the bits. But instead, this patch does the reverse: drops the
    +    final loop, and teaches the other two sites to populate the bits as they
    +    add entries.
     
    -      - it would be nice to record the generated filenames as soon as
    -        possible. We don't currently use them for cleaning up from a failed
    -        operation, but a future patch will do so.
    +    This makes the code easier to reason about, as you never have to worry
    +    about when the util field is valid; it is always valid for each entry.
    +
    +    It also serves my ulterior purpose: recording the generated filenames as
    +    soon as possible will make it easier for a future patch to use them for
    +    cleaning up from a failed operation.

    +    Two small subtleties on the implementation:
    +
    +      - in the renaming loop, we can stop re-constructing fname_old; we only
    +        use it when we have a tempfile to rename, so we can just ask the
    +        tempfile for its path (which, barring bugs, should be identical)
    +
    +      - when renaming fails, our error message mentions fname_old. But since
    +        a failed rename_tempfile() invalidates the tempfile struct, we'll
    +        lose access to that string. Instead, let's mention the destination
    +        filename, which is what most other callers do.
