Glad to see "THis" from v1 fixed.

The above description is very clear and well stated, even to someone
like me who didn't follow the discussion which culminated in this
patch.

And this final part addresses the big question which v1 left dangling
(specifically, "why the proposed patch doesn't eliminate NO_OUTPUT
altogether). Good.
