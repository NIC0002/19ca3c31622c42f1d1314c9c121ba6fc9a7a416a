Oh, good point. I was just grepping for regcomp(), but of course any
case which is already passing REG_EXTENDED would not be affected anyway.
And most places are already using that. E.g., the config code always
does so, and it looks like pickaxe "-G" does so.

For diffs, we have diff.*.xfuncname, which uses EREs. We do still
support regular "funcname" for backwards compatibility, but we only
document the extended version. Ironically, that option was introduced
because BREs did not portably support things like alternation, even with
the "enhanced" syntax. ;) See 45d9414fa5 (diff.*.xfuncname which uses
"extended" regex's for hunk header selection, 2008-09-18).

So I think we are embracing the "everyone should use EREs" mentality
already. The only spots I see that use BREs are:

  - grep.c, which handles "git grep" and "git log --grep"

  - line-range.c, presumably for "-L" function matching

  - deprecated non-ERE funcname patterns

Your patch is handling the first, which is by the far most important. I
would be OK leaving the others as-is, but I also wouldn't mind a patch
that works at the regcomp() level to make things automatically
consistent.
