The way I look at it is that you both read and write bytes, and you may 
attempt to decode and re-encode text on the way.  Both the decoding and 
the encoding are done in metadata_stream_to_writable_bytes, so nothing 
else needs to know about the raw option being different.

Perhaps it's easier to explain with a bit of (untested) code.  I was 
thinking of something like this:

def metadata_stream_to_writable_bytes(s):
     if not isinstance(s, bytes):
         return s.encode('utf-8')

     for encoding in gitConfigList('git-p4.metadataEncoding') or 
['utf-8', 'cp1252']:
         if encoding == 'passthrough':
             return s  # do not try to correct text encoding
         else:
             try:
                 return s.decode(encoding).encode('utf-8')
             except UnicodeDecodeError:
                 pass  # try the next configured encoding

     raise MetadataDecodingException(s)

I don't think it's important to be able specify the encoding to be used 
in git.  I've not spotted anyone asking for that feature.  I think it 
could be added later if someone needs it.

FWIW in the perforce repository I work with this doesn't happen much and 
I would notice the additional warning about text encodings.  I suspect 
this will be another thing which varies a lot between repositories.

I think this gets pretty messy though.  In my opinion it's not any nicer 
than putting the raw bytes in the commit message.

Git does not make any attempt enforce the commit metadata encoding, so I 
think that tools really should make an attempt to handle invalid data in 
a somewhat sensible fashion.

I don't think there is really a "right" answer, anything reasonable 
would be better than what we've got now.
