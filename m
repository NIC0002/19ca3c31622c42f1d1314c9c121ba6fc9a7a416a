Subject: [PATCH v3 0/1] docs: rewrite the documentation of the text and eol attributes
Date:   Sun, 30 Apr 2023 20:35:32 -0600

Changes from v2:
- Correct incorrect statement in commit message about dependence of
  `eol` on `text`
- Use "normalize" to refer to conversion to LF, and "convert" for
  conversion from LF
- Add Helped-by line
- Reduce wordiness/redundancy
- Add Junio's suggested phrasing to introduce `eol`

         On top of that, in several places the documentation for the eol
    -    attribute sounds like it can force normalization on checkin and checkout
    -    all by itself, but eol doesn't control normalization on checkin and
    -    doesn't control normalization on checkout either unless accompanied by
    -    the text attribute.

    +    only controls conversion on checkout. It also sounds like setting eol
    +    (or setting a config variable) is required to turn on conversion on
    +    checkout, but the text attribute can turn on conversion on checkout by
    +    itself if eol is unspecified.
     
         Rephrase the documentation of text, text=auto, eol, eol=crlf, and eol=lf
         to be clear about how they are the same, how they are different, and in
    -    what cases normalization is performed.
