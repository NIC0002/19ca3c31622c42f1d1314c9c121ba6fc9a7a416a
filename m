That is useful context.

I think that implicitly such patches can't include any (the
non-existent) 'merge-patches'..

I was looking at the 'linearised' (i.e. an ordered list) viewpoint, as I
didn't have that historic context you mentioned.

In the linear list perspective, the dropping of commits as
'simplification' would be "excluding" them, in exactly the same way that
the patch list had dropped merge commits..

Cautions and warnings, in my view, should be part of the manual,
especially if they keep coming back to bite folks. "Try it, fail and
lose work" isn't ideal when trying to learn unfamiliarÂ  techniques.

true.

as long as we don't conflate it with rev-list family linear listings..
