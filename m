Thanks for packaging this up as a proper patch.

The error-tag is plucked by the script at a couple places using a
regex such as /\?![^?]+\?!/ which won't be tripped up by the longer
and hyphenated name, so no problem there.

I had the same thought about HERE being potentially misleading, thus
wavered between HERE and HEREDOC, but ultimately chose the shorter for
length-similarity with the existing AMP and LOOP. That reminds me
that, for some time now, I've been thinking that t/README ought to
have a section explaining the meaning of AMP and LOOP (and HERE, if we
went with that) since newcomers may not intuitively understand what
such terse complaints mean.

Oddly enough, these changes look fine to me.
