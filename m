After some followup from Mathias on that list, I have determined that the issues that I a having started with the following commit:  https://github.com/git/git/commit/5a5ea141e7 ("revision: mark blobs needed for resolve-undo as reachable", 2022-06-09)

It sounds like there's a resolve-undo extension in your index that
references that blob, but the blob was removed from the repository
(probably by a gc prior to 5a5ea141e7, which was trying to prevent this
corruption).

I'd expect that the resolve-undo extension would eventually be dropped
once a merge is finished, but I'm not very familiar with that code. Is
the repository in question mid-merge, or does it happen all the time?

If there are no changes you need to keep in the index or working tree,
I expect that a workaround would be:

  rm -f .git/index
  git reset
  git update-index --refresh

to rewrite the index from scratch. Then the problem should not recur, as
you'd be using a version with 5a5ea141e7 from here on out.
