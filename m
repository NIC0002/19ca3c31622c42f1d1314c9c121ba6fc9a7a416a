These are both good ideas to consider if we need to in the future,
but it turns out that we can jump over 20.04 to 22.04 and that has
the correct feeds to install Coccinelle. I submitted an update [1].

I didn't have one in mind, but maybe someone else did? You make me
think that there is not, which isn't surprising.
