Thanks, this looks good to me. The new test is a little funny in that
it's somewhat-nonsensical input, but I find it unlikely that we'd ever
add code to treat two instances of the same filter type specially.
Compared to something that produces two distinct effects (like a blob
and tree-depth filter combined), it also requires the "test in both
directions" trick to cover everything.

But I do like that it's easier to reason about what the output _should_
be. So I don't feel too strongly about it either way.
