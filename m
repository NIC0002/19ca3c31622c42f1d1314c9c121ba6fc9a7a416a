It had a follow-up RFC[1] half a year later, adding a config option and,
after some more discussion, even command line switches[2]. But not just
IMHO is that far too much, but even you suggested to simply revert back
to the initial RFC and implement the automatic fallback[3], basically
merging it with a proper changelog[4]. As that never happened, I took up
the work and tried to do just that.

Sorry for not digging up that information for the initial patch
submission. I'll add it to v2.

Thanks a lot for the detailed review. I'll update the commit log
accordingly but will wait for more feedback to see on which solution we
want to settle on.
