Yeah, that makes sense. Hooks should respect the "quiet" flag, too, as
appropriate. But the problem here is that because the server does not
claim to support the "quiet" capability, the client is not even passing
along the message that the user asked for "--quiet".

Presumably once that is fixed, the custom messages from the server would
then respect the quiet flag. But it's possible there might be more work
needed there, too.
