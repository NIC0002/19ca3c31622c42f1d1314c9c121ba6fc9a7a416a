Yes, it would look something like that and you chose the correct spot
to detect the problem, but to get a "pretty" error message properly
positioned in the input, we need to capture the input stream position
of the here-doc tag itself in scan_heredoc_tag(). It doesn't look too
difficult, and I even started writing a bit of code to do it, but I'm
not sure how soon I can get around to finishing the implementation.

Correct. ScriptParser scans the input files for
test_expect_{success,failure} invocations in order to extract the
individual test snippets, which then get passed to TestParser for
semantic analysis.
