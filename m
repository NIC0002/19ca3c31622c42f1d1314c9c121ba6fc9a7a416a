My intention is to protect rebase (2/3) and switch (3/3).  If any of
those tests break, even if die_if_checked_out() is no longer used by
them, I try to make the original intent clear with that in there.

die_if_checked_out() was initially fine, the ignore_current_worktree was
unfortunately introduced.  I haven't checked, but other callers not
affected by the change, i.e. ignore_current_worktree = 0, his tests
should have protected them by the change.

You are right, in a future reroll, split 1/3 could leave a fairly small
commit, maybe not a bad thing.  Definitely this need a reroll, because
of the style issues, but I will wait some time for other reviewers.

I tried to maintain the relationship and the role, too.  Just introduce
the helper, as Phillip suggested and I think it is a good idea. 

Thank you.
