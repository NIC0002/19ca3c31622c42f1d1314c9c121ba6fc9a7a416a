Not in all possible computing devices, no. But in certain high-reliability and mission critical systems, there are parity checks and communication mechanisms that verify the integrity of data transfers memory-to-memory, memory-to-register, and over inter-CPU bus, and memory-to-disk-storage checks. The result of a corruption on one of my systems would result in a CPU halt rather than blindly accepting the result, taking the faulty processor offline until the cause is investigated and then reloaded or repaired. This applies to any component, including disks, CLIMs, DMA, and anything else in the architecture.
