Yeah, I certainly agree that the behavior of range-diff is surprising,
and that this is a bug.

I'd have expected the solution here would be for range-diff to stop
passing "--notes", and let "log" decide whether to show notes (based on
specific --notes=foo it gets from other_arg).

But...

I'm not clear on whether you're actually fixing two separate bugs here,
or if they need to be intertwined.

It seems like passing --standard-notes means that format-patch's
range-diff will still show the standard notes by default. Maybe I'm
misunderstanding the problem, though.
