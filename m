The argument has been made[1] in the past that the public API for the
revision machinery is not poking bits in the rev_info struct yourself,
but passing the appropriate options to setup_revisions().

And I can see the point; if option "--foo" requires twiddling both
revs.foo and revs.bar, then we have no way to enforce that callers have
remembered to do both. But if the only code which handles this is the
parser for "--foo", then we're OK.

In a non-C language, we'd probably mark "foo" and "bar" as private and
provide a method to enable the option. We could provide a function, but
we'd have no compiler help to ensure that it was used over fiddling the
bits. Possibly calling them "foo_private" would be sufficient to make
people think twice about tweaking them, though.

[1] Apologies for the passive voice; I didn't want to muddle the
    paragraph by discussing who and when. But I know this is an argument
    Junio has made; I don't know if he still stands by it these days
    (there is quite a lot of field-twiddling of rev_info by now). I'm
    not sure to what degree I agree with it myself, but I thought it was
    worth mentioning here.

My findings with -Wunused-parameter show that there are quite a lot of
places that take argv/argc but assume the NULL-termination of the argv.

If we are just re-ordering argv, though, it feels like this could still
work with a strvec. Right now a strvec with "nr" items will free items 0
through nr-1, assuming that v[nr] is its NULL invariant. But it could
free v[nr], too, in case the NULL was swapped into an earlier position.

It's a little weird already, because that swap has violated the
invariant, so trying to strvec_push() onto it would cause confusing
results. But if the general use case is to pass the strvec to
parse_options(), get reordered, and then clear() it, it should work. If
you wanted to get really fancy, push() et al could double-check the
invariant and BUG().
