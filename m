Okay, that makes sense.

Yes, s/main/current/ probably would be helpful for future readers of
the code. It's unfortunate that the term "current" can ambiguously
also be read as meaning "the up-to-date index" or "the present-time
index" as opposed to "the index in this directory/worktree", which is
the intention here. But "current" is consistent with the existing
`struct worktree.is_current`, so hopefully should not be too
confusing.
