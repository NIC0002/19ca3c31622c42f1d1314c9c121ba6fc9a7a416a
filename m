I think this works and is a reasonable thing to do. The non-obvious
question is whether the island data is ever used later in the process.
Certainly the island bitmaps themselves are, but the initial mapping of
refs to islands doesn't.

I do agree with Ã†var that it would be a lot easier to confirm that if
these variables were given a more appropriate scope (this was mostly
just laziness on my part writing the initial delta-island code; so much
of it has to stick around for the whole process and I didn't distinguish
between the two).

Yes, you've probably noticed that pack-objects does not distinguish much
between what is necessary for the various phases. A few obvious things
to look at:

  1. After the write phase, you can probably ditch the island bitmaps,
     too. In many repacks we're basically done then, but if you're
     generating bitmaps, that happens afterwards in the same process.

  2. The object traversal for pack-objects is done in-process these
     days. But after it finishes, I suspect that we do not generally
     need those object structs anymore, because all of the book-keeping
     is done in the bit object_entry array in packing_data.

     The exception would be generating bitmaps, which does need to do
     some traversal (and I think may hang on to actual "struct commit"
     pointers).

     I also don't think we have any code that clears obj_hash or
     released the pooled object pointers.

     So it's probably pretty tricky, but I suspect would yield big
     savings, since it's a per-object cost on the order of 64 bytes (so
     ~640MB on the kernel).

  3. During the bitmap phase I'm not sure if we still care about the
     object_entry struct in packing_data. It's the other big
     bytes-per-object user of memory. We need it all the way through the
     write phase for obvious reasons, but if we could ditch it for the
     bitmap phase, that may reduce peak memory during that phase.
