Funny enough the comment doesn't even scratch the surface on the genius
of that (uid_t)-1 and how it also prevents people with a signed uid_t
to misuse this code as well, while still allowing uid_t > INT_MAX.

As mentioned in the cover letter, the code without this is indeed broken
and unsafe to use in that case, so we will need to do something else (as
spelled there as well), I we were to proceed with it, which as I said
before I am totally OK with (granted we do that something else, and
promess not to misuse this somewhere later and open us to a potentially
embarrasing bug.

Agree, but even if I put a scary looking warning and tried to make this
code harder to use than it needs to be, is fairly visible and there had
been already suggestions of removing that restriction.

Which is why I said this is more a defensive programming solution than
real protection under the current constrains.

not quite, the check does "<=" so excludes no legitimate users, what
is excludes is bit multiplers of those valid users ids to work, so
if an obviously impossible to get legitimately and therefore bogus if
uid_t is 16bit value of 65536 even gets here we will not assume it was
root instead, which I would find personally embarrasing.

as I do as well, but this is only 4 characters long and getting rid of
it means we now have to do either of :

  * hope nobody has a signed uid_t as this code is broken in that case
    and will misbehave widly, more importantly we also lost our only
    way to find them and warn them ahead of time that they need to patch
    it.
  * add some aditional way to detect it and avoid this code and maybe
    even provide an alternative.

and also :

  * move back to strtol and potentially break the feature for half the
    valid users if uid_t is 32-bit unsigned as it is most likely to be
    in 32-bit systems.
  * move to an even wider integer so it will be always wider than uid_t
    which means we have to move a lot more code around at least.
