I think it would almost certainly have comparable performance in most
cases, and significantly better performance in large repositories. IIUC,
the current system has to remember the OID of every object which did not
pass the filter, and then construct a pack containing just those
objects.

It would be nice from a memory-savings perspective to not have to
remember these OIDs. But it also just seems error prone to me to do so:
what if we lose an OID, or reorder the list?

I dunno. I feel pretty strongly that implementing this in terms of:

  - Write a filtered pack.
  - Construct the list of existing packs (marked with '-') and the
    filtered pack.
  - Pass that as input to `git pack-objects --stdin-packs`
  - If '-d' given, delete any existing pack(s).

Thanks,
Taylor
