I think setting both probably is overkill. But if we are going to set
one, the important one is LC_ALL. It overrides specific LC_* variables,
which in turn override LANG. So just setting LANG would get confused if
LC_MESSAGES were set, for example.

That said, there probably is no downside to passing through both, so we
might as well do so.

Other than that, the patch is obviously the right thing to be doing. I'm
surprised it took this long for it to be a problem. ;)
