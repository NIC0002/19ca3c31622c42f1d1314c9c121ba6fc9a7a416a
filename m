Since this has become an increasingly common pattern, I appreciate
that you have standardized it here.

I focused on reading the changes to the builtins I have experience with
(commit-graph, maintenance, multi-pack-index, sparse-checkout, worktree)
and found the adaptation to the new model very clean.

The one common thing I saw was that you are updating a function pointer
that you name "fn" but it could be more informative on first reading if
it was named something like "subcommand_fn".

An upcoming conflict is going to be my bundle URI topic which is going
to replace 'git fetch --bundle-uri' with 'git bundle fetch' in its next
version. I'll wait to see how Junio applies this series and I'll think
about splitting the current series into "design doc" and "implementation"
just so I can build on your work here instead of colliding.

Thanks,
