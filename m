I agree that it is good to notice "the user thinks the branch should
already exist, for they have 'checked out' that branch, but there is
no commit on the branch yet".  I am not sure checked out on a separate
worktree as an unborn branch is always the indication that the user
thinks the branch should exist (e.g. "you allowed somebody else, or
yourself, prepare a separate worktree to work on something a few
weeks ago, but no single commit has been made there and you forgot
about the worktree---should the branch still exist?"), but that is a
separate topic.  Let's assume that the two are equivalent.

Isn't branch_checked_out() a fairly heavyweight operation when you
have multiple worktrees?  The original went to the filesystem
(i.e. check ref_exists()) only after seeing that a condition that
can be computed using only in-core data holds (i.e. the branch names
are the same or we are doing a copy), which is an optimum order to
avoid doing unnecessary work in most common cases, but I am not sure
if the order the checks are done in the updated code optimizes for
the common case.  If branch_checked_out() is more expensive than a
call to ref_exists() for a single brnch, that would change the
equation.  Calling such a heavyweight operation twice would make it
even more expensive but that is a perfectly fine thing to do in the
error codepath, inside the block that is entered after we noticed an
error condition.

Do we already cover existing "No branch named" case the same way in
this test script, so that it is OK for these new tests to cover only
the "not yet" cases?  I am asking because if we have existing
coverage, before and after the change to the C code in this patch,
some of the existing tests would change the behaviour (i.e. they
would have said "No branch named X" when somebody else created an
unborn branch in a separate worktree, but now they would say "No
commit on branch X yet"), but I see no such change in the test.  If
we lack existing coverage, we probably should --- otherwise we would
not notice when somebody breaks the command to say "No commit on
branch X yet" when it should say "No such branch X".
