That default is only true when there are no date limitations because of
email re-use. i.e. singleton persons with unique emails do fit that
default, which should be the majority.

If an old email has been reused, then that default becomes false, which
was Sean's starting point. In the corporate case, two (or more) distinct
individuals have used the same commit|author email address, and the hope
is, for a way of providing a disambiguation of those persons, based on
their email and the commit date.

With the first case we guarantee that we have named cover for all of the
chronology via bisection, while the trisection can leave gaps without
any allocation to a person,Â  or possibly overlaps.

A more convoluted case would be where three persons share the same
emails in a rollover fashion, so the mailmap's simple name/email
handover becomes knotted and intertwined in the handovers
(Joe3->Joe2->Joe1).
