Force shutdown fsmonitor daemon if the worktree root directory
is moved, renamed, or deleted.

Use Windows low-level GetFileInformationByHandle() to get and
compare the Windows system unique ID for the directory with a
cached version when we started up.  This lets us detect the
case where someone renames the directory that we are watching
and then creates a new directory with the original pathname.

This is important because we are listening to a named pipe for
requests and they are stored in the Named Pipe File System (NPFS)
which a kernel-resident pseudo filesystem not associated with
the actual NTFS directory.

For example, if the daemon was watching "~/foo/", it would have
a directory-watch handle on that directory and a named-pipe
handle for "//./pipe/...foo".  Moving the directory to "~/bar/"
does not invalidate the directory handle.  (So the daemon would
actually be watching "~/bar" but listening on "//./pipe/...foo".
If the user then does "git init ~/foo" and causes another daemon
to start, the first daemon will still have ownership of the pipe
and the second daemon instance will fail to start.  "git status"
clients in "~/foo" will ask "//./pipe/...foo" about changes and
the first daemon instance will tell them about "~/bar".

This commit causes the first daemon to shutdown if the system unique
ID for "~/foo" changes (changes from what it was when the daemon
started).  Shutdown occurs after a periodic poll.  After the
first daemon exits and releases the lock on the named pipe,
subsequent Git commands may cause another daemon to be started
on "~/foo".  Similarly, a subsequent Git command may cause another
daemon to be started on "~/bar".

+ * Shutdown if the original worktree root directory been deleted,

+ *
+ * Since the main thread did a "chdir(getenv($HOME))" and our CWD
+ * is not in the worktree root directory and because the listener
+ * thread added FILE_SHARE_DELETE to the watch handle, it is possible
+ * for the root directory to be moved or deleted while we are still
+ * watching it.  We want to detect that here and force a shutdown.

+ * Granted, a delete MAY cause some operations to fail, such as

+ * ReadDirectoryChangesW() only reports on changes *WITHIN* the
+ * directory, not changes *ON* the directory, our watch will not
+ * receive a delete event for it.
+ *
+ * A move/rename of the worktree root will also not generate an event.
+ * And since the listener thread already has an open handle, it may
+ * continue to receive events for events within the directory.
+ * However, the pathname of the named-pipe was constructed using the
+ * original location of the worktree root.  (Remember named-pipes are
+ * stored in the NPFS and not in the actual file system.)  Clients
+ * trying to talk to the worktree after the move/rename will not
+ * reach our daemon process, since we're still listening on the
+ * pipe with original path.
+ *
+ * Furthermore, if the user does something like:
+ *
+ *   $ mv repo repo.old
+ *   $ git init repo
+ *
+ * A new daemon cannot be started in the new instance of "repo"
+ * because the named-pipe is still being used by the daemon on
+ * the original instance.
+ *
+ * So, detect move/rename/delete and shutdown.  This should also
+ * handle unsafe drive removal.
+ *
+ * We use the file system unique ID to distinguish the original
+ * directory instance from a new instance and force a shutdown
+ * if the unique ID changes.

+ * Since a worktree move/rename/delete/unmount doesn't happen
+ * that often (and we can't get an immediate event anyway), we
