Also naming - we normally prefix test environment variables with 
GIT_TEST_. IKNOWWHATIAMDOING does not tell us what we are allowing by 
setting the variable. Something like GIT_TEST_ALLOW_SUDO would tell us 
what we're letting ourselves in for by setting it.

I'm confused by this as well. Also if $1 is empty we run whatever 
happens to be in $CMD.
