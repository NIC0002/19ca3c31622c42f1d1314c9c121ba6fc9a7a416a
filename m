True.

Everything I saw in this patch looked reasonable.  Except for one
minor thing that I found a bit iffy.

We use the name of an operation (e.g. "pull", "fetch", ...)  to
refer to a specific command name and also as a general concept.  The
former should be in `pair of backticks`, but not the latter.
Unfortunately, there is no bright line between the two.

It is OK to say that this "pull" refers to the command line we see
above, i.e. "git pull", but ...

... it is unclear if this one should be taken as a "literal
example".  It may flow more naturally if we take it as the name of
general concept of one operation, as ...

... it contrasts with the "fetch" operation and the "merge"
operation referred to here a bit better, it seems.  The same for the
reference of `fetch` in the next paragraph.

But as I said, it is quite minor and I am not even convinced it is
wrong, so let's take the whole thing as is and merge it down.

Thanks.
