TBH, I think just running the linter once per test script when the
script is run would be sufficient. That is one extra process per script,
but they are already shell scripts running a bunch of processes. You get
parallelism for free because you're already running the tests in
parallel. You lose out on "don't bother linting because the file hasn't
changed", but I'm not sure that's really worth the extra complexity
overall.
