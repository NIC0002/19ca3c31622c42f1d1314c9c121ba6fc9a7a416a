This is on macOS, I assume? With glibc it seems to be quietly ignored:

  $ git grep -E -o 'foo.*?ba' .clang-format
  .clang-format:foo, bar, ba

So it is not treated literally (as it would be without -E). But nor does
it make the match non-greedy (otherwise it would have output "foo, ba",
as "git grep -P" does).

So it does seem like all bets are off for what people can and should
expect here. Which isn't to say we should make things worse. I mostly
wondered if REG_ENHANCED might take us closer to what glibc was doing by
default, but it doesn't seem like it.
