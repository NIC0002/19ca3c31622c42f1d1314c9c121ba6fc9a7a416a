Ah, the same line / braces choice (as per coding guidelines).

This is the pre-existing problem, that ~1in 2^31 size changes might not
get noticed for size change. The 0 byte / 4GiB change is an identical
issue, as is changing from 3 bytes to 4GiB+3 bytes, etc., so that's no
worse than before (well maybe twice as 'unlikely').

They'd be protected by the EXPENSIVE prerequisite I would assume.
Any particular test t/txxx that they should be placed in (I'm not that
familiar with the test suit)
