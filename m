I had been avoiding reading this series too carefully, as I was involved
in many of the early patches. But now it's been long enough that I
mostly forgot everything, so I could look at it with fresh eyes. ;) Plus
the hidden-refs bits at the end were totally new to me.

It looks good to me overall. I left a few small comments, some of which
I think probably justify a re-roll.
