Well, my intention is to state that the recommendation is not recent.
Perhaps it is confusing to not state clearly that it is also current.

I'm not sure if there is any path that might use "", but the
consideration is there since introduced in cf818348f1 (Report
information on branches from remote.h, 2007-09-10).

Of course, as you pointed out, there are usages where a computed value
is used, perhaps coming from the user, which might end up specifying
"HEAD".  Those usages of branch_get() are not considered here.  Not even
indirect ones.

Having said that, the goal in this change is to aid following, now and
in the future, when using a literal with branch_get(), the
recommendation we already have.  Which, IMHO, is also the optimal usage.

As a collateral, we save some cycles; either at runtime, avoiding the if
(!strcmp("HEAD", "HEAD")) to the user; or better, at compile time,
saving the compiler from optimizing out that strcmp.

I have to admit I have this change in mind, not in the current form, but
in the same direction, since my patches for builtin/branch.c, a few
months ago.  When, reviewing the use of branch_get() I was a bit
confused.

Thanks.
