That thought crossed my mind, as well, but I'm hesitant to leave a known
bug in place that can cause a deadlock. It would be one thing if we
could muddle through without nonblock in a slower way, but I don't think
we can easily detect this situation after the fact.

So maybe some options are:

  - don't bother with O_NONBLOCK unless the size of the input is over N
    bytes. The trouble there is that it's not clear what N should be.
    It's fcntl(F_GETPIPE_SZ) on Linux, but that's not portable. We could
    possibly come up with a conservative value if we had a ballpark for
    pipe size on Windows. It feels a bit hacky, though.

  - we could actually guess at a deadlock by putting a timeout on the
    poll(). That would also catch hanging or slow filter processes. I
    really hate putting clock-based limits on things, though, as it
    means the tool behaves differently under load. And keep in mind this
    is deep in the pipe_command() code. It happens to only trigger for
    diff filters now, but it may be used in other spots (in fact it
    already is, and it's only the size of current gpg payloads/responses
    that means it doesn't happen to trigger).

Stepping back, though, I think we should consider why we'd see an error
here. I wouldn't expect it to ever fail on a system where O_NONBLOCK was
supported. If we want to make it a silent noop on some platforms, then
we can stick that into the enable_nonblock() function (which is what I
did, but as Ren√© showed, that is probably not a good enough solution).
