sudo on my machines is very specific that it does not preserve much of the environment. This causes all kinds of DLL load issues too. We rarely can build regression test suites that include sudo testing. More than that, it is general policy that password-less sudo is frowned upon, so I'm pretty sure we cannot run this test. When we run the git test suite, it is done by a user who is, by design, excluded from the sudoers file because regression tests happen in a sandbox.
