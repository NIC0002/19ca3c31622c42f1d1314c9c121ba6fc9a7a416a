Sounds sensible.

I'd expect that there is a way (e.g. "git fsck") that helps the
users notice when the actual filesystem layout contradicts with what
the gitdir-to-gitdir link says, and repair the repositories when
they go out of sync if possible.

It would be similar to "git worktree", where a link between the
".git" file that records "gitdir:" in a secondary worktree and the
repository's $GIT_DIR/worktrees/*/gitdir, and the "repair" command
can be used to bring them back in sync after moving the real
repository without telling the secondary worktree about the move.

The other side of the coin is that, even when a configuration
variable says that you are a submodule of the superproject at
location X, if such a submodule gets moved out of the superproject
(perhaps because the end-user wanted to concentrate on that
submodule project alone as an independent project) and the
superproject that used to be at location X got archived away,
trusting and relying on what the configuration variable says would
not help us access the now-gone superproject.  And that would not
change no matter how strongly we declare that it is the source of
truth.

Unless we have a very good way to detect inconsistency and stop
spreading the damage (e.g. the setting thought our superproject sits
at directory X, but that location is now occupied by a different
repository that is not related), I am still skeptical about the
"setting is the sole truth" design.
