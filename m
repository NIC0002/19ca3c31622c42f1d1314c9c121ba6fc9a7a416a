Yeah, I agree this addresses the point I raised (which I am somewhat
regretting raising, as IMHO it was not worth the amount of discussion
that has ensued).

Since nobody asked, my _real_ opinion is that I prefer Ren√©'s original
that used an actual struct, and its auto-freeing strvec. And I'd be
happy to see all of the run_command_v() variants go away entirely. It
does save a few lines, but with modern niceties, it's not very many, and
it's much less flexible.

I resisted saying so earlier because I do not think it is even worth
anybody's time to think about, let alone implement.
