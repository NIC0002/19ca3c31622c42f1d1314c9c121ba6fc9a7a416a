Oh, right. Probably:

	if (obj->type == OBJ_TAG) {
		const struct object_id *tagged_oid = get_tagged_oid((struct tag *)obj);
		if (oid_array_lookup(points_at, tagged_oid) >= 0)
			return tagged_oid;
	}

would have been a better way to write the original, but the new one with
the loop is better still. ;)

I also notice that the function returns a pointer to an oid, even though
the sole caller only cares about a boolean result. Not that big a deal,
though the memory lifetime of the return value is confusing.  We might
return "tagged_oid" which points to a struct that will live forever, but
we might also return "oid" directly, which points to memory passed in
from the caller with a limited lifetime.
