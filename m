OK, thanks.  I wasn't worried about "musl", but rather whether
you were running the stress test on a Linux or Mac.

Since they have different backends (inotify vs FSEvent) and all
the code that touches the filesystem is different, it would best
to start on the correct OS when trying to repro it.


Can you tell from your stess test whether the fsmonitor-daemon
is crashing?  (It might be subtle since the daemon is auto-started
if necessary, so it might be crashing and silently getting restarted
by the next command.)

I ask because a SIGPIPE in the client would make me think that the
server suddenly closed the connection unexpectedly, like if it had
SIGSEGV'd or something.

I won't have time to spin up a Linux VM until next week, so I
won't be able to investigate this for a bit.
