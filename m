Ah, good find. That kind of explains everything, then, I think. ;)

Right, that makes sense. It would have to in order to meet the atomicity
requirement for write(), but still always make forward progress for each
write().

I wouldn't be opposed to that, in the sense that it's supposed to be a
black box to the caller, and it's relatively small in size. But I think
we're pretty close to having something usable without that, so I'd like
to pursue a smaller fix in the interim.

That makes sense. We end up busy-looping between poll() and write()
while we wait for our read descriptor to become available. But if poll()
doesn't block, that's the best we can do.
