It feels like generating the code as above is not the end of the world.
The most valuable thing that coccinelle is doing here is _finding_ the
location, and telling you "it's supposed to be like this". It is great
when the "this" post-image is perfect and doesn't need further tweaking.

But if the compiler then reminds you "hey, you need to go a bit further
manually", that doesn't seem so bad. In other words, I would be happy to
follow that work flow if I introduced a bare xcalloc(). My only worry is
that somebody less experienced with the project (or with C) would get
confused.
