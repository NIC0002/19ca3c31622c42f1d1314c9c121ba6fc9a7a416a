How about doing it in something that's not ls-tree? Sounds like you
already have a script, it just takes a bit too long?

Something similar to

In a repo with many files, maybe use git diff --name-only and just run
it periodically as a part of a check-in hook or something?

  git diff --name-only HEAD~100..HEAD | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | sort | uniq -d

That's not to say this isn't a good idea but for now I'd advice an
automated scripted route.
