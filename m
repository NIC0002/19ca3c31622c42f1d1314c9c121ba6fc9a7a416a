Great. I think even replacing the dictionary with regular
strbuf_expand() would be an improvement in terms of the on-demand
loading. But I am happy to see it go all the way to the iterative
version. :)

Your comment above does make me wonder if strbuf_expand_step() should be
quietly handling "%%" itself. But I guess strbuf_expand() doesn't, and
your branch.c quote-literal example probably would not want that
behavior.
