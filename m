When the user starts a bisection in a worktree, we save the branch
currently checked out in that worktree (BISECT_START) to allow the user
to go back to that branch later on.

From that moment and until the bisection ends, the branch is no longer
checked out in that worktree, but we give it the same consideration as
if it was checked out, which means that we prevent:
 - deleting that branch and
 - checking out that branch in another worktree, unless the user force
   the ckeck out.

"bisect" was introduced as a helper script in 8cc6a08 ([PATCH] Making it
easier to find which change introduced a bug, 2005-07-30), and
originally based its functioning in Git builtin commands.  Although
"bisect" is now itself a builtin command, it still spawns Git
sub-processes to use other builtin commands, like "checkout".

Since 1d0fa89 (checkout: add --ignore-other-worktrees, 2015-01-03) we
have a safety valve in "checkout" and "switch" commands to prevent the
user from normally checking out simultaneously the same branch in
multiple worktrees.

If the user, using "--ignore-other-worktrees", checks out a branch
before or while bisecting that same branch in another worktree, we may
fail when the user ends the bisection using "git bisect reset":

   $ git worktree add work ../work/
   $ git checkout --ignore-other-worktrees work
   $ git -C ../work bisect start HEAD HEAD~3
   ... the user inspects some commits ...
   $ git -C ../work bisect reset
   fatal: 'work' is already checked out at ...
   error: could not check out original HEAD 'work'. Try 'git bisect reset <commit>'.

Thanks to the special consideration we give to the branch while being
bisected, and the safety valve introduced in 1d0fa89, we can assume the
user is aware and responsible of the "multiple checked out branch"
situation.  This makes sensible to allow the user to go back to the
original branch using "git bisect reset" and avoid him a somewhat less
intuitive sequence like: "git bisect reset work~0 && git checkout
--ignore-other-worktree work".

Let's teach "bisect" to use the "--ignore-other-worktrees" when the user
wants to end the bisection.

Changes since v2

 - Reworded the message to be more descriptive.
 - Using "||:" to chain commands in the test_when_finished block,
   suggested by Eric.

This series started because of a bug, being fixed in another series,
allowed "git bisect reset" to work in certain cases where multiple
branches were checked out.  Once the bug is fixed, "git bisect reset"
will no longer work in those scenarios.  Which is not bad, but taking
into account the different scenarios and the fact that some users may
rely on this bug as a feature, I think that the current patch proposes a
sensible and convenient change for the user.

Range-diff against v2:
