The GDPR isn't as onerous as some suggest, as it isn't a set of black
and white rules, rather in cases like these you need to have a real
strong reason for why data is retained etc, such as being part of the
verification and validation of the commit data. There have been various
discussions around this in many of the technical journals.

It maybe that your internal Git version could disable the particular
`format` option ('%ae'?) for the original name, so only the designated
('redacted') mailmap entry is shown to casual users (assumes the repo is
inside the corporate firewall). This would avoid invalidating the repos
validation capability, while meeting the needs of GDPR type regulations.

In the same vein, a local Git version could, being open source, add
allowances for your extra mailmap entry details, such as adding a post
fix " % <approxidate>" limits for the use of the particular name/email
combo to allow date ranges to emerge.

I noted that all the .mailmap examples in the man page have ">" as the
final character, but I haven't looked to see if the code always requires
that the last element of the entry is an <email> address, or whether it
currently barfs on extra elements.
