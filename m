Yep, looks good. One small comment:

Adding the NULL-initialization signals that we expect that real_orig_ref
might sometimes _not_ be filled in by dwim_branch_start(). But I think
it always will be; and if it weren't, that would make passing it to
setup_tracking() rather suspicious.

So I don't think the NULL initialization is wrong, and certainly it is
more defensive. But I find it a little misleading.
