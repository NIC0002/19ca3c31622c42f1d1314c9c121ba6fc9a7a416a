I think you have a good point here. Blame is associated with the commit which is not a specific person (might be a group though). In some (a few, but growing) companies I am dealing with, the core.user and core.email are associated with a nameless single sign on (SSO), or tokenized user, in order to be compliant from a regulatory standpoint. This includes GDPR in Europe and the Privacy Act in Canada. In these cases, there is no identifying information in the commit itself, but externally in the organization's HR and IT departments where identifying information is tightly controlled. Cause and effect will always exist, no matter how one might choose to semantically hide the usage. Words do matter, but identifying information may not for much longer. Perhaps that approach might help the OP's organization in their jurisdiction, to dissociate the commit from the person except during a specific audit context.
