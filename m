Hi Elia,

Given Junio's comment regarding the potential for patch churn, it may,
as an alternative, be possible to create a script that will
check/extract just those those changes that are either:

A) mistakes in patches between say master and seen `master..seen` so
that they aren't incorporated, though `next..seen` may be more appropriate.

B) detect 'while you are at it' fixes that could be applied to a file
that is being modified with the same range query. The file fix-up patch
could/would then be inserted as preparatory step to the relevant series
(i.e. fed to the series author), allowing easy reversion with/without
the fix-up.

C) suggest to coccinelle that maybe they include a similar Git based
range check option, to avoid needing a fancy script [using Junio's
rationale].

D) more clearly identify _why_ the particular instances that are
corrected are _worth_ changing now (e.g. fixing _one_ may be a worthy
GSOC or Outreachy activity, or .. <insert own reasons>).

Â Hope that helps.

Philip
