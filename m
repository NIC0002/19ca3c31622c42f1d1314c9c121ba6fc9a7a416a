Thanks for explaining that. If there is no <start-point> given we don't 
reset the branch so it seems a bit harsh to error out here. For "git 
checkout -B <branch> <start-point>" when <branch> is checked out in 
another worktree requiring --ignore-other-worktrees makes sense.

It's a good point that it makes the intention clearer, maybe we should 
just leave it as it is.

Oh, of course. I was so focused on the -b that I'd forgotten we need the 
same check when we're checking out an existing branch - thanks for 
putting me right.

I think it would be clearer so say that rather than "conflicted" which 
has a strong association with merge conflicts.
