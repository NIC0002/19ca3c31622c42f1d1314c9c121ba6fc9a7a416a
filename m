I mean that later in the process, if we need to find an object we may
open the .idx file to look for it. So by opening them all up front, we
_might_ just be doing work that would get done later.

But it's not guaranteed. Imagine you have 10,000 small packs, and one
big bitmapped pack. If you can serve the request from just the big pack,
then you'd never need to open those other .idx files at all. However,
the current code will open them anyway.

I care less about mmap space, and more that it's work (syscalls, and
examining the contents of the idx) to open each one. It's probably not
even measurable unless you have a ton of packs, though.

I don't mean the order in which we look at packs. I mean the order of
operations in open_pack_bitmap_1(), something like:

diff --git a/pack-bitmap.c b/pack-bitmap.c
index 440407f1be..1df2f6c8b6 100644

But we can further observe that the first thing is_pack_valid() will do
is open the idx file. :) So we can really just drop this line entirely,
I'd think.

BTW, another oddity I noticed in this function. We check:

   if (bitmap_git->pack || bitmap_git->midx) {
	   /* ignore extra bitmap file; we can only handle one */
	   ...
   }

but it's impossible for bitmap_git->midx to be set here. If we opened
the midx bitmap, we'll skip calling open_pack_bitmap() entirely.
