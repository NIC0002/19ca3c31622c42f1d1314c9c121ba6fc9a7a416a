The sub-modules already have that problem if the user forgets publish 
their sub-module (see notes in the docs ;-).
> The submodule "type" could create an object (hashed and stored) that contains the needed "translation" details. The object would be hashed using SHA1 or SHA256 depending on the git config. The format of the object's contents would be defined by the submodule's "code".

Another way of looking at the issue is via a variant of Git-LFS with a 
smudge/clean style filter. I.e. the DataVCS would be treated as a 'file'.

The LFS already uses the .gitattributes to define a 'type', while the 
submodules don't yet have that capability. There is just a single 
special type within a tree object of "sub-module"Â  being a mode 16000 
commit (see https://longair.net/blog/2010/06/02/git-submodules-explained/).

One thought is that one uses a proper sub-module that within it then has 
the single 'large' file git-lfs style that hosts the hash reference for 
the data VCS 
(https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/spec.md). It would be 
the regular sub-modules .gitattributes file that handles the data 
conversion.

It may be converting an X-Y problem into an X-Y-Z solution, or just 
extending the problem.
