Yeah, that was what I found after digging deeper (see my patch 7).

Yeah, I agree that the use of a signed int there looks questionable. I
do think it's orthogonal to my series here, as that tree-decoding is
used by the existing hash-object checks.

But it probably bears further examination, especially because we use it
for the fsck checks on incoming objects via receive-pack, etc, which are
meant to be the first line of defense for hosters who might receive
malicious garbage from users.

We probably ought to reject trees with enormous names via fsck anyway. I
actually have a patch to do that, but of course it depends on
decode_tree_entry() to get the length, so there's a bit of
chicken-and-egg. We probably also should outright reject gigantic trees,
which closes out a whole class of integer truncation problems. I know
GitHub has rejected trees over 100MB for years for this reason.

Seems reasonable. I doubt there's an interesting attack here, just
because the mode isn't used to index anything. If you feed a garbage
mode that happens to overflow to something useful, you could just as
easily have sent the useful mode in the first place.

Certainly it would waste some time parsing the tree, but you could do
that already with a long pathname. Or just having a lot of paths in a
tree. Or a lot of trees.
