I understand your concern, and can relate to the amount of effort it
took to narrow down the problem. Nevertheless, even though you
encountered this problem in relation to git-worktree, it's a more
general issue which can manifest in other situations. As such, I can't
think of a good way to discuss the issue in the git-worktree
documentation that wouldn't feel out of place and make the
documentation more confusing.

I'm not necessarily opposed to someone else giving it a shot if it can
be done in a way which doesn't feel out of place and doesn't confuse
git-worktree documentation further (especially for those new to the
documentation). I just don't know how to do so myself.
