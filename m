You mention below that this is a correctness issue, but I am not sure
that I agree.

The existing behavior is a little strange, I agree, but your argument
relies on an assumption that the history on hidden refs is not part of
the reachable set, which is not the case. Any part of the repository
that is reachable from _any_ reference, hidden or not, is reachable by
definition.

So it's perfectly fine to consider objects on hidden refs to be in the
uninteresting set, because they are reachable. It's odd from the
client's perspective, but I do not see a path to repository corruption
with thee existing behavior.

Nice, here we expect a pretty good speed-up, and indeed...

I'm nitpicking, but this would be preferable as "if (oidset_size(announced_oids))"
without the "!= 0".

Why do we see a slowdown when there there aren't any hidden references?
Or am I misunderstanding your patch message which instead means "we see
a slow-down when there are no hidden references [since we still must
store and enumerate all advertised references]"?

If the latter, could we avoid invoking the new machinery altogether? In
other words, shouldn't receive-pack only set the reachable_oids_fn() to
enumerate advertised references only when the set of advertised
references differs from the behavior of `--not --all`?

This looks like trading one problem for another. In your above example,
we now need to store 20 bytes of OIDs 6.8M times, or ~130 MiB. Not the
end of the world, but it feels like an avoidable problem.

Could we enumerate the references in a callback to for_each_ref() and
only emit ones which aren't hidden? Storing these and then recalling
them after the fact is worth avoiding.

Thanks,
Taylor
