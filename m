Discovering that an object appears in one of the packs whose objects
we're excluding from the resulting pack is extremely cheap, since we
have a cache of just those packs (see the call to
`has_object_kept_pack()` in `want_found_object()`).

I'd think that in small cases the performance is probably worse, though
the working set would be small enough for the differences to not matter
that much in absolute terms.

In cases with many objects, storing all of their OIDs in memory would be
a pain.

Thanks,
Taylor
