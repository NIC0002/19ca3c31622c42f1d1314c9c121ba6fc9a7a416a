I don't know if git-repair will fix syntactic problems in commits like
this, or if it's just looking for broken links between objects. But
regardless, it would be possible to fix these using filter-repo or other
tools.

The problem with repairing them is that it rewrites history, changing
the object id of every commit which comes after.  So you'd want to do it
once centrally for the project, and declare a flag day that everybody is
moving over to the new, fixed history.

It's probably not worth it for a minor problem like this.
