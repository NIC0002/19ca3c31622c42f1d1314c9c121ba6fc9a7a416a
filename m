Ah, right, I should have checked to see if _we_ are using them before
guessing whether anyone else might be.

Thanks, I dug around for something like that but somehow missed it.

So yeah, we definitely want to keep this abbreviation feature working.
The only question is whether we ought to detect ambiguous ones. I think
something like this would work, though I wonder if is even worth

curiosity while I was adjusting something else in the function:
