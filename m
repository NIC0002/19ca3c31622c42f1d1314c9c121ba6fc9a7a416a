Yeah, I saw that. It's a bit vague, and if the call returns ENOSYS or
EISDIR, that would be perfectly fine. It's the "what happens on the
implementations that do support it..." part that I'm more worried about. :)

That said...

Right, I'm a little embarrassed I didn't immediately come up with this
same fix. This is definitely the right thing to do. The more we can
treat data from signal-handlers are write-once, the better.

There's a slight extra memory cost to store the directory name twice,
but it's a drop in the bucket overall.

The patch itself looks good to me.
