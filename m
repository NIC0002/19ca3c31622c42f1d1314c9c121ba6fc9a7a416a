I pretty much agree with that worldview, but I try hard not to assume
"my taste is good" when going into a technical discussion. If only
because I've embarrassed myself a sufficient number of times. :)

Did you mean run_command_v() here? If so, then yes, it requires the
flags. But if we are going to drop it in favor of just run_command(),
then those flags go away (and moving to the _l() variant is a step in
the opposite direction).
