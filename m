I see both of your points, and I agree adding the flag will only make 
users type the flag without thinking.


But I still don't understand why do we need git clean without any flags.


The only users that will run git clean are new users that don't know you 
need to run it with -f or experienced users that set clean.requireforce 
= false.


Moreover, we can also assume that every user that have 
clean.requireforce = true (the default), and ran git clean, did so by 
mistake/intended to clean, So why don't we offer him interactive way to 
understand the consequences and confirm his action? (and explain about 
clean.requireforce like we currently do).
By doing it this way, the change will not effect experienced users 
because they either run git clean -f when they need to clean or they set 
clean.requireforce = false, and then the change will not apply to them.


This argument is also for stash clear.


Thanks.
