I can only hope. I am working with the platform compiler team on time_t issues. Hoping we can get to 64-bit builds within two years, but out of my control. That would make time_t an int64_t, which puts failure well outside my own lifespan and anyone else in my company. Provisioning for signed 64-bit time values would be prudent even if unsupported in a specific build. We are almost 1/4 through 20xx.
