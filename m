I thought the code for that was a better and clearer description.  I'll add
some details to the message.

OK.  I'll split that in two.

2/3 and 3/3, I think makes more sense on its own commit.

Sorry.  I'll fix that.

OK.  Yes, I was playing with this, changed my mind and ended up with this and
the other style below, mess.

I think the comment still makes sense as is for the new function, both the
description and the recommendation.  I will review it again.

I tried to maintain the terms as much as possible.  I'll think about the name
you suggest.

I'll fix this.

Again, that was an attempt to maintain the terms from find_shared_symref().


Thank you for your review.
