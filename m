Thanks for digging here. I think it probably explains a lot of "wait,
why did this result change" head-scratching I did back when we started
batching a few years ago.

Is there any reason we wouldn't want --recursive-includes to be added to
the default SPATCH_FLAGS?

I suspect we'd still want to leave --all-includes there to get as much
type information as possible. If I understand correctly, the two are
orthogonal (one is "follow includes of includes" and the other is
"follow system includes in angle brackets").

Doing so doesn't seem to find any other missed entries in the current
codebase, but I'm pretty sure there are some it would have caught in a
less mysterious fashion over the years.
