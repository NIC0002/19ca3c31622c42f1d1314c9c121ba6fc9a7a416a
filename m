Subject: [PATCH v3 0/2] Generate temporary files using a CSPRNG

Currently, when we generate a temporary file name, we use the seconds,
microseconds, and the PID to generate a unique value.  The resulting
value, while changing frequently, is actually predictable and on some
systems, it may be possible to cause a DoS by creating all potential
temporary files when the temporary file is being created in TMPDIR.

The solution to this is to use the system CSPRNG to generate the
temporary file name.  This is the approach taken by FreeBSD, NetBSD, and
OpenBSD, and glibc also recently switched to this approach from an
approach that resembled ours in many ways.

Even if this is not practically exploitable on many systems, it seems
prudent to be at least as careful about temporary file generation as
libc is.

In this round, I've switched to allow multiple values for the makefile
variable to make our usage in autoconf easier.  I have not submitted any
changes to the autoconf code, since the defaults are fine for most
situations, and even a fallback to /dev/urandom should be okay in most
places.

I also haven't included multiple values in config.mak.uname since
there's little reason to do so: the BSDs all have had arc4random for a
long time, Windows and NonStop have only one good option, and no other
systems have a value set.

A range-diff appears below for your convenience.

Changes from v2:
* Switch from a single option in the makefile variable to multiple
  options.
* Change the name of the libbsd option to "libbsd" so it doesn't share a
  substring with other options due to the function we use.

Changes from v1:
* Remove the automatic testing using buckets because it didn't seem to
  add much.
* Switch to a single makefile variable.
* Add support for OpenSSL CSPRNG.
* Add more defaults for various systems, including macOS and NonStop.
* Add an arc4random-libbsd variant for improved testing of the
  arc4random code paths on Linux.  The only difference is the inclusion
  of an additional header.
* Print a more useful error message than before, indicating that the
  CSPRNG failed.
