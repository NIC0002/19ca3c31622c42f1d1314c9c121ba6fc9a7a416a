In terms of a "real" fix to this kind of problem, I'm thinking that
we actually need to be sure we've parsed things like core.useReplaceRefs
when loading the object database for the first time.

Here, I'm suggesting the simplest fix before we can go about a more
rigorous change to prevent this from happening again.

The custom ahead-behind builtin that we have in our fork once also had
this same problem, and the fix was exactly like this. The impact was
less severe (mostly, things slowed down because the commit-graph was
disabled, but also the numbers could be different from expected).

Thanks,
