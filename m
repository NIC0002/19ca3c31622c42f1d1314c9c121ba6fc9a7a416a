Hi Abhradeep,

Thanks for drafting your initial GSoC proposal. Some thoughts inline:

That's good to know. Do let us know if you have any experience with C
and shell programming outside of your contributions to Git.

Good to see your various contributions to Git so far. Good work!

Taylor has shared feedback on the proposal and timeline which I hope are 
helpful to you. Specifically, Taylor said:

I agree with this. It's better to be practical than ambituous when 
planning the proposal.

Thanks for letting us know of possible things that would interfere with 
GSoC! Do make sure to keep us posted in case you come to know of 
anything else.

That's nice.
