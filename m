Well, less proposing and more thinking out loud. :)

One thing that I think would make it awkward is that some people (well,
me at least) tend to show diffs repeatedly. So I might look at a diff
several times, and then even run format-patch multiple times as part of
my workflow of sending it. Interactively expanding the diff each time,
and then losing that result, would be annoying.

So an interactive tool that somehow output "oh, and here are some
parameters you can feed back to get the same view" would be my ideal.
