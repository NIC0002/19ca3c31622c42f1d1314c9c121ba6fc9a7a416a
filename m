What does ">8" means? 

It's like a Github internal patch between the ">8"
and "<8" marks, right?

Yes, currently there will be only one bitmap to be process and other
ones will be skipped, so we should remove it I think because it's no
actual meanings for client uses, they do not care about what the server
skipped and hope to avoid the disturbing information.

"ships in git.git" means as the git developers, right?

I agree, let things expose entirely, but it's a trade-off.

I think it's no need for a new config knob here, I agree with you on this
point.

And keep the pack basename seems like definitly a better solution than
the current one and I have a other solution which is to replace "warn()"
to a trace2 api, so the developer of git or ships in git.git if I
understand it right ;-) could get the warning in trace2 output by:

I don't know which is better and I will go on reading the left replies.

Thanks for the hard working on this patchset, Taylor, really appreciate for that.
