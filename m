Sorry, I don't find this description clear at all due to the many 'or's
and 'and's and no indication which parts belong together. The original
text was clear (but, of course, not helpful if it was wrong).

I suggest to rewrite the paragraph into format with bullet points:

   ... only if one of the following is true:

  - is set and foo or bar
  - is unspecified and either
      - this
      - or that
  - is set to auto but not...

or something along the lines. I can't propose actual text because I have
no clue what the truth is.
