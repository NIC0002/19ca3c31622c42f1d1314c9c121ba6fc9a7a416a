This is built on top of ds/sparse-checkout-requires-per-worktree-config and
includes some forward fixes for comments from that series.

 * Patch 1 combines two translatable messages into one. (Thanks, Jean-NoÃ«l)
 * Patches 2-4 extract methods from the already-busy add_worktree() method.
   (Thanks, Eric)
 * Patches 5-11 update git-worktree.txt to use 'worktree' over 'working
   tree'. This involves some rewrapping of the paragraphs, so the diffs are
   not obviously just a find and replace. I split the changes mostly by
   section of the file to keep the diffs from being too large.


Updates in v2
=============

Based on Junio and Taylor's review, I updated some language in the docs:

 * Some uses of "worktree" should have stayed as "working tree"
 * Some adjacent wording was improved.

Thanks, -Stolee
