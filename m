Subject: [PATCH 3/4] tests: drop here-doc check from internal chain-linter

Commit 99a64e4b73c (tests: lint for run-away here-doc, 2017-03-22)
tweaked the chain-lint test to catch unclosed here-docs. It works by
adding an extra "echo" command after the test snippet, and checking that
it is run (if it gets swallowed by a here-doc, naturally it is not run).

The downside here is that we introduced an extra $() substitution, which
happens in a subshell. This has a measurable performance impact when
run for many tests.

The tradeoff in safety was undoubtedly worth it when 99a64e4b73c was
written. But these days, the external chainlint.pl does a pretty good
job of finding these (even though it's not something it specifically
tries to flag). For example, if you have a test like:

	test_expect_success 'should fail linter' '
	        some_command >actual &&
	        cat >expect <<-\EOF &&
		ok
		# missing EOF line here
	        test_cmp expect actual
	'

it will see that the here-doc isn't closed, treat it as not-a-here-doc,
and complain that the "ok" line does not have an "&&". So in practice we
should be catching these via that linter, although:

  - the error message is not as good as it could be (the real problem is
    the unclosed here-doc)

  - it can be fooled if there are no lines in the here-doc:

      cat >expect <<-\EOF &&
      # missing EOF line here

    or if every line in the here-doc has &&-chaining (weird, but
    possible)

Those are sufficiently unlikely that they're not worth worrying too much
about. And by switching back to a simpler chain-lint, hyperfine reports
a measurable speedup on t3070 (which has 1800 tests):

  'HEAD' ran
    1.12 Â± 0.01 times faster than 'HEAD~1'

I didn't look at how hard it would be to teach chainlint.pl to complain
about the unclosed here-doc. I think it _might_ actually not be that
bad, just because it does already understand here-docs in general. If it
handled that, then all of the hand-waving in the second half of the
commit message could go away. ;)

I'd also be OK dropping this. 12% is nice, but this one test is an
outlier. Picking t4202 somewhat at random as a more realistic test, any
improvement seems to be mostly lost in the noise.
