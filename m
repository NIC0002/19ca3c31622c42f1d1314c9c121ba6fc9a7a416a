Thanks for finding that.
It's clearly a good idea to disable PCRE2_UCP for those using those
older, known-buggy versions of pcre2.

The latest is 10.42, per https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2/releases

Thanks for all of the links. However, have you seen justification
(other than for compatibility with some other tool or language) for
allowing \d to match non-ASCII by default, in spite of the risks?
IMHO, we have an obligation to retain compatibility with how grep -P
'\d' has worked since -P was added. I'd be happy to see an option to
enable the match-multibyte-digits behavior, but making it the default
seems too likely to introduce unwarranted risk.
