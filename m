It is always "C", because that's what our tests do. And we found that

That part's what we already do, and...

This won't do anything, because we set LC_ALL in the test scripts, which
takes precedence over LANG. Eric used it in his real-world testing
because he quite sensibly does not have LC_ALL set in his usual shell. :)
