Indeed, that would explain it.

This is appealing since the internal linter is nearly zero-cost,
though doing this would not fully address the "recipe for confusion"
since the two linters would still not be in agreement. This approach
does have the benefit that it gives at least _some_ protection (minus
caveats mentioned below) on platforms where it may be common to
disable chainlint.pl due to slowness, such as Windows.

The value of the internal linter is fairly limited in that it only
checks top-level &&-chain; it doesn't check inside subprocesses,
blocks, or any compound statement (case/esac, if/fi, while/done,
etc.).

I retained the internal linter in place "just in case" (i.e. in the
event the script missed something legitimate), but I don't feel
strongly about it.
