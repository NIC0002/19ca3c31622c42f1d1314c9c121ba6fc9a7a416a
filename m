These last two are unlike most of our other boolean variables, where we
complain about bad values:

  $ GIT_TEST_ASSUME_DIFFERENT_OWNER=bogus git rev-parse
  fatal: bad boolean config value 'bogus' for 'GIT_TEST_ASSUME_DIFFERENT_OWNER'

  $ GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS=10000000000 git rev-list HEAD -- foo
  fatal: bad boolean config value '10000000000' for 'GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS'

Why is it too late then? If we're going to do a hard die() anyway (as
above), whether it happens after a bit of output or not doesn't seem
like that big a deal. And if we never flush and look at the variable,
and the user "gets away" with a bogus value, nothing is harmed. That's
how existing variables work (e.g., try removing the pathspec from the
rev-list invocation above).

If that behavior is OK, then we could just use git_env_bool() here
(though the patch size isn't much different; as you noted, most of the
change comes from flipping the variable).
