I think we're already munging the strvec arrays in the option parser,
though. I'm just suggesting that parse_options() swap arguments to the
end instead of overwriting a NULL (actually, I'm not even sure it
doesn't do that already), and strvec_clear() checking the final element.
The end state is not necessarily safe, but it's no worse than what we
have today.

That said...

Yes, I thought your original patch actually got to the root of the
problem. strvec owns the array and its elements, and parse-options wants
to munge the array itself (but not the elements). Making a shallow copy
is eliminates the conflict over ownership.
