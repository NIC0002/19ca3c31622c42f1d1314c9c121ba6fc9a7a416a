Hmm, that's true.

I agree with you. But I think these two points(specially (2)) deserve
a dedicated discussion/patch thread. Because, the latest version of this
patch series (actually this patch series itself) only cares about the
`usage strings`.

So, I argue you to not discard the last commit for now. As you said `There are
already tons of "check sanity of what is inside option[]"`, integrating
one more sanity check would not affect it. I am saying it not because
I made that commit. The discussion or patch integration of (2) and (3)
may take few weeks (or more than a month may be; I also would like to
take part/contribute to that discussion/PR). I fear that another
set of invalid usage-strings would be added in that time. In that case,
we have to make another commit/PR for correcting those strings - disrupting
the purpose of this first commit you are willing to merge.

As Ã†var also said -

Thanks :)
