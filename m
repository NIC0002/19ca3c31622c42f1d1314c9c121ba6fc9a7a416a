I think this is kind of a red herring, isn't it? The bug report is about
refs, and I don't think those really respect core.ignorecase either way,
and inconsistencies are known to happen on case-insensitive filesystems
(because the refs are sometimes case-sensitive and sometimes not
depending on whether they are packed or loose in the filesystem).

So I think this is just a known gotcha, and the path forward is probably
a new ref storage format that doesn't rely on storing names directly in
the filesystem (reftable, or some system based on packed-ref slices).
