I share your concern, I thought about it.

My thoughts evaluating the change were more or less:

 - presumably there should be many more references than worktrees, and
   more repositories with 0 or 1 workdirs than more, so, arbitrarily,
   calling ref_exists() last still sounds sensible

 - strcmp() to branch_checked_out() introduces little change in the
   logic

 - I like branch_checked_out(), it expresses better what we want there

 - branch_checked_out() considers refs, strcmp considers branch names
   (we have a corner case with @{-1} pointing to HEAD, that this
   resolves)

 - finally, perhaps branch_checked_out() has optimization possibilities.
   Maybe in the common case we can get close to the amount of work we
   are doing now.  Here we can alleviate a bit by removing the
   unconditional resolve_refdup(HEAD) we are doing at the beginning of
   cmd_branch().

In the end, it seems to me that we have some places where we are
considering HEAD and we may need to consider HEADs.

And again, I agree, the change has somewhat profound implications.

I think we do, bcfc82bd (branch: description for non-existent branch
errors).  We have some pending changes to follow the CodingGuideLines in
this messages that maybe we can resume:

Thank you for reading the change this way.
