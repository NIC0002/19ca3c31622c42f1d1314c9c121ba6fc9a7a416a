Sort of. The leak-check build itself is not what goes public, so we have
already diverged from a release build. But yes, if there were cases that
-O2 caught that -O0 did not, that would be of interest.

But are there?

I.e., we already know of false positives with -O2. Are there false
negatives with -O0?

The example you give below goes the other way:

It is a false negative with -O2. Which again seems to argue for using
-O0.

I don't know why we'd want to prefer -O2 if we know it produces worse
results, but don't have any cases where it produce better ones (or even
a plausible explanation for why it might). Sure, we could squelch its
false positives with UNLEAK(), but:

  - that's per-site work, versus setting -O0 once

  - UNLEAK() suppresses false positives, but it also would suppress true
    positives (e.g., if the code later changed and somebody introduced a
    leak). It seems better to avoid that if possible.
