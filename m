Everything in this section looks good. Though I wonder whether readers
will wonder how one subscribes to the list. You sort of address this
earlier in the proposed document, but I think it's worth clarifying here
to indicate the differences between subscribing to a public list like
this one, and the invite-only git-security list.

Perhaps something like:

    [...] the archive is closed to the public, and only accessible to
    invited members.

    There are a few dozen such members: [...]

which is basically just s/subscribed/invited, but I think it adds some
worthwhile clarity.

Looks good, though I am unsure what "priorities and requirements" refers
to specifically. Could you elaborate?

A few nitpicks on this and the above bullet point:

  - The git-security list isn't for bug reports, though there can be a
    security component to something that looks like a bug report.

    Perhaps to be clearer we should swap "bug" for "potential
    vulnerability"?

  - On "within a couple of days", I think that this is aspirationally
    true, though not always the case. Perhaps, "as soon as possible"
    instead? That's vague enough that I wouldn't worry about somebody
    reading this document >2 days after submitting a potential
    vulnerability wondering why nobody has gotten back to them ;-).

  - Finally, consider replacing "core Git team" with "member of the
    git-security list".

There's a third option, too, which is using the private git/cabal
repository. Anybody who is a member of the @git/security team on GitHub
has access to this repository. And it is often a convenient option for
coordinating releases that contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability.

There aren't any hard and fast rules for which approach should be used
in a given circumstance, but I think it's worth mentioning it as another
option.

For my own $.02, I often find it useful to *start* by sending patches to
the git-security list inline with the thread so that the original
reporter (who is more often than not *not* a member of the @git/security
team) can participate in review (or at least look at the patches).

The private forks tied to a security advisory are often convenient
(assuming that the reporter has a GitHub account) since they provide a
shared workspace. But I think we usually avoid them when working on
preparing a release for more than one vulnerability.

I strongly agree with the above two points.

For what it's worth, GitHub does usually prepare a public blog post, but
I don't think we've typically shared them with the git-security list
ahead of time. Not because there's anything sensitive in there (I
personally would have no problem sharing them with git-security ahead of
time if there was interest), but just because nobody has asked. It may
be worth clarifying which communications we expect to have reviewed by
the git-security list during this period and which we do not.

This is all good. I would add some of the things we need to figure out
before opening a security advisory, too. By the time we want to open a
security advisory, we need to have the following information decided
upon:

  - Affected version(s)
  - Patched version(s)
  - Impact
  - Potential workaround(s), if any
  - Credit for finding and fixing the vulnerability

Determining which versions to patch is more-or-less up to the person
preparing those patches. Affected versions is usually "everything", or
"everything since xyz patch was merged". Impact is up for debate, though
usually whoever opens the security advisory writes this, and then
discussion occurs on the git-security as to its accuracy ;-).

Obtaining permission to give credit to the original reporter (and
anybody that they wish to include who was also involved in the
discovery) is important to do at this step, too.

Thanks,
Taylor
