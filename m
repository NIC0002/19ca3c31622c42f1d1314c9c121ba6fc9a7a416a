It was a semi-rhetorical question.  Whether the reasons for expluding
files are sound or not, it should be convincingly justified in the
commit message.

Or about disk space.  Which, because of the potentially significantly
reduced number of files in the work tree can bring along significant
performance benefits, even with quadratic behavior.

I used the following command to create a sparse-checkout from
linux.git to build and play with 'perf':

  git sparse-checkout set tools/perf/ tools/scripts/ tools/build/ tools/include/ tools/arch/x86/ tools/lib/ /.gitignore /.gitattributes

Including the top-level '.gitignore' and '.gitattributes' was
important, becase those ignore object files and specify userdiff.
Now, I wouldn't mind having other files present in the top-level
directory, because there are only a handful of files there.  However,
being able to specify just those two files to 'git sparse-checkout'
was great, because I didn't even have to think about what wildcard
pattern to use, and what negative pattern to use to exclude anything
that might have been included recursively.

I don't remember having any performance issues with it, on the
contrary, I do remember that Git suddenly became much faster that in
the full worktree.

So I'm fairly convinced that specifying files to sparse-checkout is a
feature that can make users' life easier.  It certainly made my life
easier.


On a related note: I just noticed the leading slashes in '/.gitignore'
and '/.gitattributes'.  __git_complete_index_file() is not ready for
that, I'm afraid; but I don't think the proposed patches could deal
with that, either (but I didn't actually try).

It would be great if completion could cope with patterns starting with
'/' and/or '!'.
