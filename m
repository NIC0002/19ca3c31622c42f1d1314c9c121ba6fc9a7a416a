I hadn't really considered having a pre/post hook for the daemon.
I'm not opposed to it; I just hadn't thought about it.

By this I assume you mean something inside the fsmonitor--daemon
process that invokes the hooks when it is starting/stopping.
As opposed to something in a client command (like status) before
it implicitly started a daemon process.  The latter method would
not give you post-hook events because the daemon usually outlives
the client command.

Perhaps you could elaborate on what you would use these hooks for
or how they would be helpful.  It would be easy to add pre/post
hooks in the main thread of the daemon.  However, I worry about
the prehook slowing the startup of the daemon -- since the client
status command might be waiting for it to become ready.  I also
have a "health" thread in part3 that would be a candidate for
pre/post and any other periodic hooks that might be useful.
But again, before I suggest a design for this, it would be good
to know what kind of things you would want to do with them.

Jeff
