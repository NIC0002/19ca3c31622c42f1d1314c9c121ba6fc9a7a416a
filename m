Visual Studio users enjoy support for running the test suite via CTest,
thanks to Git's CMake definition.

In https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/3966, it has been reported
that this does not work out of the box, though, but causes a couple of test
failures instead. These problems are not caught by Git's CI runs because the
vs-tests jobs actually use prove to run the test suite, not CTest.

In addition to fixing these problems, this patch series also addresses a
long-standing gripe I have with the way Git's CMake definition supports
CTest: It edits t/test-lib.sh, which leaves this file eternally modified
(but these modification should never be committed, they refer to a
local-only, configuration-dependent directory).

Note: The signed/unsigned comparison bug in git add -p that is fixed in this
here patch series is a relatively big one, and it merits further
investigation whether there are similar bugs lurking in Git's code base.
However, this is a much bigger project than can be addressed as part of this
patch series, in particular because the analysis would require tools other
than GCC's -Wsign-compare option (which totally misses the instance that is
fixed in this here patch series).

Changes since v2:

 * Enhanced a commit message to clarify how the "cumbersome approach" looks
   like when a developer wishes to pass options to the test scripts in
   Visual Studio.
 * Changed the base branch to ac/fuzzers, to avoid merge conflicts in
   .gitignore.
 * Moved the PANIC check in test-lib.sh so that it is not skipped when the
   file GIT-BUILD-DIR exists.

Changes since v1:

 * Clarified why it is a good idea to pass --no-bin-wrappers and
   --no-chain-lint when running on Windows.
 * Clarified why the add -p bug has not been caught earlier.
 * Clarified the scope of this patch series to fix running Git's tests
   within Visual Studio.
 * Increased the time-out for the very slow t7112 test script.
 * The test_chmod was determined to be not only faulty, but unneeded, and
   was dropped.

          Like in Git's CI runs, when running the tests in Visual Studio via the
          CTest route, it is cumbersome or at least requires a very unintuitive
     -    approach to pass options to the test scripts.
     +    approach to pass options to the test scripts: the CMakeLists.txt file
     +    would have to be modified, passing the desired options to _all_ test
     +    scripts, and then the CMake Cache would have to be reconfigured before
     +    running the test in question individually. Unintuitive at best, and
     +    opposite to the niceties IDE users expect.
      
          So let's just pass those options by default: This will not clutter any
          output window but the log that is written to a log file will have

          While at it, also imitate what the Windows jobs in Git's CI runs do to
          accelerate running the test scripts: pass the `--no-bin-wrappers` and
     -    `--no-chain-lint` options. This makes the test runs noticeably faster
     -    because the `bin-wrappers/` scripts as well as the `chain-lint` code
