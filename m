Filip, maintaining software is a big responsibility; 
       if Git were easy, maintaining would still be work.

is it Junio's fault that there a so many questions on SO?

Git stands head and shoulders above other versioning software products;
the reason is that Linus designed a superior system.

You might find Git easier to use from these links:

whether first learning Git, or reviewing what one already knows, I very strongly recommends that one starts here:
Git :: 4 short introductory videos from https://git-scm.com/doc
Total running time c. 25'
https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control
https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-git
https://git-scm.com/video/get-going
https://git-scm.com/video/quick-wins
4 short introductory videos from https://git-scm.com/doc"
Note:  imho, the 4 short videos above, although limited in content, set the tone and spirit for beginning a friendship with Git; links below actually teach you Git.
"Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency."

BOTTOM LINE:  the command line is a powerful way to use Git.


imho, Git is to version control as Tesla is to VW Beetle.

Filip, sounds to me like you make stuff up, like when you write:
  "The financial damage goes into the billions."


i stay neutral regarding Junio because unless you prove
otherwise, i imagine that Junio is both doing a decent job
and likely not even getting paid for it.

Subject: Request to remove Junio C Hamano as the Git Maintainer

There are more than one million questions on Stackoverflow related to the usage of Git.
This is not normal. 

Git is in its current state not a tool that's made for humans.

It's realistic to assume, that millions of working hours were wasted due to his ignorance of developer experience.
The financial damage goes into the billions.

I hereby request the removal of Junio C Hamano 濱野純 as the Git Maintainer.
