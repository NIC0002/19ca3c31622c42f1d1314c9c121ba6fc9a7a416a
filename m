Naming is a big issue [1,2].

Do you already have a map of those personal name and email name changes
that are causing conflicts, or are you hoping for a way of detecting
such changes? If you already know which names produce conflicts you are
more than half way there.

If you do know of the name conflicts, (e.g. when `John Doe` changed to
`Jane Doe2`, then acquired `Jane Doe`, before being put back to `Jane
Doe2`), do you have dates for the change over to map into the commit
dates (assuming no slop or author/committer date slip). At least with
the change-over dates you can apply mapping during the history transfer.

An alternate option is to simply stick with the fact that history is
messy, and use internal corporate knowledge for the few case that cause
the major issues. It some point it always gets to be a GÃ¶del Grammar
(needing another rule).
