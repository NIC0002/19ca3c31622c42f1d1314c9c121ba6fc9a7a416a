These points make sense. It would be worth taking our time and
doing some refactoring in advance of this functional change.

I wonder how we could test a multi-user scenario. The tests I
added in e47363e5a (t0033: add tests for safe.directory, 2022-04-13)
purposefully avoid the user-id functionality.

I agree that the idea behind this change is a good one. The escalation
of privilege isn't a huge concern when the "real" user is the same.
The only way to trick the root user here is to set an environment
variable, in which case they might as well modify PATH and be done with
it.

Similar spelling error here.

I imagine that something else could be added here to help Windows
users who have elevated to administrator privileges. It will use a
completely different mechanism, though, if needed at all. We can
delay that for now.
