That should be correct, although the OS Devs I spoke to about this said "EPERM". I am experimenting.

Part of the OS Dev's response was that POSIX is actually ambiguous on this point. Linux made the decision to use ENOENT. NonStop decided to use EPERM (although it may actually be EACCESS - I will report back.

I will report my debug findings.
