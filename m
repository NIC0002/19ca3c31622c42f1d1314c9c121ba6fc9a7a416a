I added a branch selection dialog to the remove command, triggered when there is more than one branch on the selected commit. It works fine and is convenient to use. However, the implementation is more complicated and the patch is much larger.

Since the patch is larger I felt that it was warranted to clarify some variable names.

The checkout command also has got a branch selection dialog.

Create and remove commands have been put in separate commits.
