For what it's worth, I had the same reaction as Junio upon reading
this patch; specifically, that it will train users to type "git stash
clear --force" mechanically without thinking, thus won't be much of a
safeguard.

"git clean" is in a rather different (and more severe) boat since file
deletion is irrevocable, whereas a stash thrown away by "git stash
clear" (or "git stash drop") can be recovered (at least until it gets
garbage-collected). So, rather than adding a --force option or an
interactive "yes/no" prompt, perhaps a better approach would be to
have "git stash clear" (and "git stash drop") print out advice
explaining to the user how to recover the dropped stash(es), much like
"git switch" or "git checkout" prints advice explaining how to recover
commits left dangling on a detached head.
