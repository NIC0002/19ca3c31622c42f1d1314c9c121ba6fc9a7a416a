I think part of the reason cmake rose in importance via CI is that it's
the de facto way to build for vscode. Before that CI job switched to
cmake, there was some other alternate build system (vcxproj).

So two things I'd consider here:

  - how important is it for us to do the vscode build as part of regular
    CI (as opposed to folks who are interested in it running it
    themselves). Dscho gave some real data in the thread I linked to
    earlier (which indicates that yes, it helps, but not that often).

  - what's the status of cmake versus vcxproj? My impression (though I
    admit based on my half-paying-attention-to of the topic) is that
    cmake should replace vcxproj, and nobody would ever want to work on
    vcxproj anymore. But if that's not right, then does vcxproj cause
    headaches for non-Windows devs less often? I don't really remember
    dealing with it much, but I may have just been lucky.

I think that's just the normal platform issues. You don't use it on your
system, so you don't notice until it runs in CI. If people don't run CI
themselves, then it falls to the maintainer's CI run, which is a pain
for them. But that's as true of other operating systems, exotic test
flags, etc, as it is of cmake.

That seems like going in the opposite direction from what you're saying
above: doubling down that if cmake is broken by a change, it is the
responsibility of the dev who made the change to find and fix it.

I do like that Ã†var is trying to make it easier to run cmake from Linux
in order to find that without using CI. But that does seem orthogonal to
me to the notion of "who is responsible for finding and fixing cmake
problems". To me, that decision is really rooted in "is cmake something
the Git project supports, or is it a side-thing that some folks
volunteer to keep working?".

I don't mind having it in-tree if I can ignore it (assuming the project
attitude is the "it's a side thing" from above). It's the CI failures
that make it hard to ignore.
