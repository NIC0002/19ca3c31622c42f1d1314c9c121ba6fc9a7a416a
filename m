I'm still unsure what you are trying to say here.

Is this a question about the prior `trunc`, `mtrunc`, and `ltrunc`
design and tests?
e.g. how complete are their tests?

Is it looking for an extended explanation of the 'fit in N-columns'
design approaches that they all have?

I'm happy to add a paragraph saying that an `Mtrunc`, i.e. miss out the
middle characters to fit the set column width, without using the two dot
ellipsis (`..`), was considered a non starter because of potential
confusion when looking at such output when tabulated.

The existing code (and tests) already covers the need to hide the
characters those two dots (ellipsis) consumed win the N-column tabulated
output. The tests also include utf8-encoded characters.

All the previous tests for `trunc` and `'ltrunc` (i.e. with ellipsis)
have been repeated for the `Trunc` and `Ltrunc` (without ellipsis) hard
truncation commands, and their expected outputs updated, including the
use of the qz_to_tab_spaceÂ  for those case where trailing spaces are now
present.

Does that cover your questions?
