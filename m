In fact I didn't read it, I rather re-read it ;-)

(I'm in the CC list there, so it should not have been a surprise I did
read it then.)

There were quite a few tests performed and methods were polished before
Johannes has been persuaded to give the feature a try, some of the tests
being complex enough, and both methods did perform rather well. That is
what he calls "initial tests" there I believe, and then he found the
case that is very important to him, but lead him to nested merge
conflicts, that is indeed quite bad.

Well, it was you who gave me the reference to comment on, and that was
the only disadvantage I was able to find being discussed there. I also
don't recall any other objections back then when the problem has been
discussed a lot.

You just repeat saying the same thing, without any further arguments?
OK, thank you for your opinion anyway.

It works. Really.

From my POV particular problem space (rebasing commits) already uses the
diffs, and only them, that's why I can't figure how you end up coming to
such conclusion.

OK, I participate only in hope that there will be somebody who actually
cares enough to implement it. Maybe it will be me, maybe not, and I
already got it that neither you nor the original author of git-rebase
are interested.

Sure it'd be nice. Fortunately there is nothing mutually exclusive here.
