Yes, but I still don't understand what you are worried about.

If we compare with "rebase": "git rebase --abort" does checkout back to
the original branch too.  But as "git rebase" is in a more evolved
"builtin transition", and uses reset_head() instead of spawing a new Git
with "checkout", it avoids the "--ignore-other-worktrees".

The safety I'm considering with "git bisect reset" is that while a
branch is being bisected in a worktree, that branch cannot be (without
forcing): checked out in another worktree, deleted or renamed.

And this safety is enough, to me, to alleviate the user from having to
"git bisect reset" to a "safe" place and then "git checkout
--ignore-other-worktrees" to have the BISECT_START branch checked out
again.

Also, note that the aim of this patch is not to introduce a new behavior, but
fix how "git bisect reset" works with multiple worktrees.
