Thanks for finding those. I'd add

  - libtap https://github.com/zorgnax/libtap which seems to have nice
      assertions and TAP output. It is licensed under LGPL3 but used
      to be GPL2 and there don't seem to have been many changes since
      the license change so we could just use the older version.

I think it would be helpful to have a section in the plan which clearly 
states the features we want (TAP output, helpers that make it easy to 
write tests with good diagnostic output, ...) in our unit test framework 
and explains how the selected solution meets those criteria.

It would also be helpful to have a guide to writing effective tests that 
sets out some guidelines on where unit tests are appropriate and 
outlines our expectations in terms of style, coverage, leak cleanliness etc.

Best Wishes

Phillip
