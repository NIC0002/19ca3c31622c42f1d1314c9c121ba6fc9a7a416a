This (instruction clarification) is being discussed / sorted at
[git-for-windows/git] Include trailing slash in prefix migration
instructions (PR #3790)
https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/3790

The key point being that for a `//server` path you will need three
slashes. (IIUC) One for magic prefix string, and then two as part of the
server name.

There is now also the `*` option that permits all as safe directories.Â 
Worth checking how the user and group security is being handled locally,
especially for accidental failures.
