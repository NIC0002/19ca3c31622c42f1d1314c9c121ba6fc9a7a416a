Hmph, how so?  Especially once you split 1/3 into the preliminary
refactoring and the real fix, the fix becomes fairly small and
clear.  And the tests to protect the fix would go best in the same
commit.

OK.  Thanks.

When you did not change a thing in such a way that it does not
change the relationship between that thing and other things, it
makes perfect sense to keep the same term to refer to the thing.
Otherwise, once the thing starts playing different roles in the
world, there may be a better word to refer to the updated and
improved thing.
