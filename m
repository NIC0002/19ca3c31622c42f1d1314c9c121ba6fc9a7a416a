OK.  I'll reword the message with that.

OK.

This is the current situation:

   $ git checkout --detach 
   HEAD is now at 2efe05c commit-a

   $ git checkout HEAD~1
   Previous HEAD position was 2efe05c commit-a
   HEAD is now at 7906992 commit-b

   $ git worktree add test --detach && git worktree remove test
   Preparing worktree (detached HEAD 7906992)
   HEAD is now at 7906992 commit-b

Maybe "HEAD position was" fits for both usages.  This is how it would
look like:

   $ git checkout -
   HEAD position was 7906992 commit-b
   HEAD is now at 2efe05c commit-a

   $ git worktree add test --detach && git worktree remove test
   Preparing worktree (detached HEAD 2efe05c)
   HEAD is now at 2efe05c commit-a
   HEAD position was 2efe05c commit-a

Or just "HEAD was at":

   $ git checkout -
   HEAD was at 2efe05c commit-a
   HEAD is now at 7906992 commit-b

   $ git worktree add test --detach && git worktree remove test
   Preparing worktree (detached HEAD 7906992)
   HEAD is now at 7906992 commit-b
   HEAD was at 7906992 commit-b

I think, if there are no objections or better suggestions, I'll re-roll
with "HEAD was at".
