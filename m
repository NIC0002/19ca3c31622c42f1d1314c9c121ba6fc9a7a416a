With the recent turnover on the git-security list, questions came up how
things are usually run. Rather than answering questions individually,
extend Git's existing documentation about security vulnerabilities to
describe the git-security mailing list, how things are run on that list,
and what to expect throughout the process from the time a security bug
is reported all the way to the time when a fix is released.

+The `git-security` mailing list
+-------------------------------
+
+Responsible disclosures of vulnerabilities, analysis, proposed fixes as
+well as the orchestration of coordinated embargoed releases all happen on the
+`git-security` mailing list at <git-security@googlegroups.com>.
+
+In this context, the term "embargo" refers to the time period that information
+about a vulnerability is kept under wraps and only shared on a need-to-know
+basis. This is necessary to protect Git's users from bad actors who would
+otherwise be made aware of attack vectors that could be exploited. "Lifting the
+embargo" refers to publishing the version that fixes the vulnerabilities.
+
+Audience of the `git-security` mailing list
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Anybody may contact the `git-security` mailing list by sending an email
+to <git-security@googlegroups.com>, though the archive is closed to the
+public and only accessible to subscribed members.
+
+There are a few dozen subscribed members: core Git developers who are trusted
+with addressing vulnerabilities, and stakeholders (i.e. owners of products
+affected by security vulnerabilities in Git).
+
+Most of the discussions revolve around assessing the severity of the reported
+issue (including the decision whether the report is security-relevant or can be
+redirected to the public mailing list), how to remediate the issue, determining
+the timeline of the disclosure as well as aligning priorities and
+requirements.
+
+Communications
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+If you are a stakeholder, it is a good idea to pay close attention to the
+discussions, as pertinent information may be buried in the middle of a lively
+conversation that might not look relevant to your interests. For example, the
+tentative timeline might be agreed upon in the middle of discussing code
+comment formatting in one of the patches and whether or not to combine fixes
+for multiple, separate vulnerabilities into the same embargoed release. Most
+mail threads are not usually structured specifically to communicate
+agreements, assessments or timelines.
+
+Typical timeline
+----------------
+

+- Once the review has settled and everyone involved in the review agrees that
+  the patches are ready, the Git maintainer, and others determine a release date
+  as well as the release trains that are serviced. The decision regarding which
+  versions need a backported fix is based on input from the reporter, the
+  contributor who worked on the patches, and from stakeholders.   Operators
+  of hosting sites who may want to analyze whether the given issue is exploited
+  via any of the repositories they host, and binary packagers who want to
+  make sure their product gets patched adequately against the vulnerability,
+  for example, may want to give their input at this stage.
+
+- While the Git community does its best to accommodate the specific timeline
+  requests of the various binary packagers, the nature of the issue may preclude
+  a prolonged release schedule. For fixes deemed urgent, it may be in the best
+  interest of the Git users community to shorten the disclosure and release
+  timeline, and packagers may need to adapt accordingly.
+
+- Subsequently, branches with the fixes are pushed to private repositories that
+  are owned by the Git project, with tightly controlled access.
+
+- The tags are created by the Git maintainer and pushed to the same
+  repositories.
+
+- The Git for Windows, Git for macOS, BSD, Debian, etc. maintainers prepare the
+  corresponding release artifacts, based on the tags created that have been
+  prepared by the Git maintainer.
+
+- The release artifacts prepared by various binary packagers can be
+  made available to stakeholders under embargo via a mail to the
+  `git-security` list.
+
+- Less than a week before the release, a mail with the relevant information is
+  sent to <distros@vs.openwall.org> (see below), a list used to pre-announce
+  embargoed releases of open source projects to the stakeholders of all major
+  distributions of Linux as well as other OSes. This includes a Git bundle
+  of the tagged version(s), but no further specifics of the vulnerability.
+
+- Public communication is then prepared in advance of the release date. This
+  includes blog posts and mails to the Git and Git for Windows mailing lists.
+
+- On the day of the release, at around 10am Pacific Time, the Git maintainer
+  pushes the tag and the `master` branch to the public repository, then sends
+  out an announcement mail.
+
+- Once the tag is pushed, the Git for Windows maintainer publishes the
+  corresponding tag and creates a GitHub Release with the associated release
+  artifacts (Git for Windows installer, Portable Git, MinGit, etc).
+
+- Git for Windows release is then announced via a mail to the public Git and
+  Git for Windows mailing lists as well as via a tweet.
+
+- Ditto for distribution packagers for Linux and other platforms:
+  their releases are announced via their preferred channels.
+
+- A mail to <oss-security@lists.openwall.org> (see below for details) is sent
+  as a follow-up to the <distros@vs.openwall.org> one, describing the
+  vulnerability in detail, often including a proof of concept of an exploit.
+
+Note: The Git project makes no guarantees about timelines, but aims to keep
+embargoes reasonably short in the interest of keeping Git's users safe.
+
+Opening a Security Advisory draft
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The first step is to https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/new[open
+an advisory]. Technically, this is not necessary. However, it is the most
+convenient way to obtain the CVE number and it give us a private repository
+associated with it that can be used to collaborate on a fix.
 
 Notifying the Linux distributions
----------------------------------
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 At most two weeks before release date, we need to send a notification to
-distros@vs.openwall.org, preferably less than 7 days before the release date.
+<distros@vs.openwall.org>, preferably less than 7 days before the release date.
 This will reach most (all?) Linux distributions. See an example below, and the
 guidelines for this mailing list at
