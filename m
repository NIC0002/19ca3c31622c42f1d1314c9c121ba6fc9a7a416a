It's possible that we should be more strict about the separator, but I
think the real bug is that we are respecting a separator at all in this
example.

That "---" handling is meant for format-patch/am-style processing, where
the commit is embedded in an email. And there it is an unfortunate but
accepted limitation that you can't put "---" separators in your commit
message, or the parsing will get confused.

But when we run "git commit --trailer", we know that we have a complete
commit message, not an email. And so we should not look for "---" at
all. But we do, and the commit object we write is broken (the trailer is
in the wrong spot):

  $ git commit -m "A bad commit
  
  --- let's mess stuff up ---
  
  Have fun
  " --trailer "old-scm-change-id:THIS TRAILER GETS LOST"

  $ git cat-file commit HEAD^
  tree 1dd017bdd070190005e5e162d87afebcd61e0fa8
  author example <a@b.com> 1686888121 -0400
  committer example <a@b.com> 1686888121 -0400
  
  A bad commit
  
  old-scm-change-id: THIS TRAILER GETS LOST
  
  --- let's mess stuff up ---
  
  Have fun

On the display side, I think "--format=%(trailers)" is doing the right
thing here; it is not respecting the "---", because it knows we have a
complete commit message from the object, not something we're trying to
pull out of the email format (so it finds nothing, because the trailer
is not at the end). Likewise, "cat-file | interpret-trailers" is doing
the right thing; by default it respects the divider. These examples
probably ought to be doing:

  git cat-file commit HEAD^ |
  git interpret-trailers --parse --no-divider

to tell interpret-trailers that we are feeding it a pure commit message,
not an email.

So I think the only bug is that "commit --trailer" should not respect
the divider. And the fix presumably:

diff --git a/builtin/commit.c b/builtin/commit.c
index e67c4be221..9f4448f6b9 100644
--- a/builtin/commit.c
+++ b/builtin/commit.c

I cannot think of a reason we wouldn't want to do that (though obviously
it would need a test to become a patch). But it's possible I'm missing
some use case (e.g., would anybody feed format-patch-ish output to "git
commit --trailer ... -F" and expect it to handle the "---" divider? That
seems odd to me).

I'm adding Christian to the cc, since he wrote most of the original
interpret-trailers code and may have thoughts.
