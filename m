Several reasons:

Maybe the original branch was pushed already, and I'm collaborating on
it with a coworker. At the same time, I want to run my rebase experiment
in parallel on a copy.

Maybe I want to create github PRs for both of them, in order to run CI
on them, or get feedback for both of them from my coworkers.

Also, it just seems to be the most natural workflow for many people. I
have seen my coworkers do this a lot without thinking much whether there
would be a better way.

My question is not so much whether copying branches is a good idea, it's
more about how --update-refs should deal with copied branches *if* you
decide to use them.
