Subject: [PATCH 2/4] tests: replace chainlint subshell with a function

To test that we don't break the &&-chain, test-lib.sh does something
like:

   (exit 117) && $test_commands

and checks that the result is exit code 117. We don't care what that
initial command is, as long as it exits with a unique code. Using "exit"
works and is simple, but is a bit expensive since it requires a subshell
(to avoid exiting the whole script!). This isn't usually very
noticeable, but it can add up for scripts which have a large number of
tests.

Using "return" naively won't work here, because we'd return from the
function eval-ing the snippet (and it wouldn't find &&-chain breakages).
But if we further push that into its own function, it does exactly what
we want, without extra subshell overhead.

According to hyperfine, this produces a measurable improvement when
running t3070 (which has 1800 tests, all of them quite short):

  'HEAD' ran
    1.09 Â± 0.01 times faster than 'HEAD~1'
