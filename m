... meaning you can "--force", or something else?  Allowing an
existing option to be used as the safety valve does make sense,
especially if the option is something users are already familiar
with (like "--force") and naturally expected to work.

There might need an documentation update.  Back when "checkout -b"
and "branch" was written, there wasn't "multiple worktrees connected
to a single repository" hence there was no need to provide safety
against checking out the same branch in two different places.  "git
branch" might have learned th give that safety while "git checkout
-b", which _ought_ to be equivalent to "git branch" followed by "git
checkout", might have forgot to do so.  After this change, it may
still be correct to say that "checkout -b" is equivalent to "branch"
followed by "checkout", but if the documentation to "branch" talks
about this safety, it probably deserves to be mentioned in the
documentation to "checkout -b", as well, if only to give an appropriate
place to talk about how to override it "with an existing flag".

Thanks.
