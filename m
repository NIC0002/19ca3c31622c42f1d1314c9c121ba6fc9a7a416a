We say in the documentation:

   +
   If `-B` is given, `<new-branch>` is created if it doesn't exist; otherwise, it
   is reset. This is the transactional equivalent of
   +
   ------------
   $ git branch -f <branch> [<start-point>]
   $ git checkout <branch>
   ------------
   +

and, since 55c4a67307 (Prevent force-updating of the current branch,
2011-08-20), we return with error on "git branch -f <current-branch> [...]".

Therefore, when the current branch is checked out in multiple worktrees, it
seems consequent to error on "git checkout -B <current_branch> [...]".

But we want to allow "git checkout -B <current_branch>", without <start-point>,
as a way to say "git reset --keep", see: 39bd6f7261 (Allow checkout -B
<current-branch> to update the current branch, 2011-11-26).

Your suggestion not to error is not only reasonable, but also seems desirable.

Thanks.
