Some examples of what I have in mind. There are more, but this covers what I have in mind urgently:

1. Setting up a lock file (semaphore) just before fsmonitor runs that will cause any scripts that might change the state of the repository on the fly to suspend until fsmonitor is done.
2. Ensuring that in-flight scripts that do stuff are finished or not leaving the repo in a transitional state before fsmonitor runs - holding fsmonitor until the pre-hook finishes.
3. Notifying syslog or some other paging system if something has gone horribly wrong - as in fsmonitor found something bad in the index.
4. Clearing any semaphores created earlier (example 1).

Regards,
Randall
