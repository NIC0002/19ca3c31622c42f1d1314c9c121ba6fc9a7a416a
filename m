Urgh, whoops. That was from some last-minute tweaking of the comment.
There was also a line:

  git diff --color | wc -c

before it so I could measure how big the output was for a few values.

It snuck into the emailed patch, but the actual test runs (including the
Windows CI) didn't include that (since obviously they'd have failed the
test).

Thanks for catching.
