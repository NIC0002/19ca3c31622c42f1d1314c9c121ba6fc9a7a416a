Coccinelle doesn't care about whether a function is called or whether a
macro is called.  It considers everything to be a function.

Something like this:

@r1@
expression e;
@@

N(e)

@script:python s@
e << r1.e;
replacement;
@@

if string_ok e
then cocci.include_match(False)
else coccinelle.replacement = "\"better string\""

@@
expression r1.e;
expression s.replacement;
@@
- N(e)
+ N(replacement)

------------------

You can fill in the definition of string_ok and better string.  I think
the \" will be necessary, because the value of an expression metavariable
at the python level is a string, so there should be a string inside of it
to make it a string expression.
