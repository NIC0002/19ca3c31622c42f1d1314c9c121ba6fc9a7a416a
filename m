Yes, I think it will do what the right thing here. And having just
written up a quick series, the only tests which needed changes were ones
with syntactic problems. :)

I'll send it out in a few minutes.

Yes, but it does so with lookup_commit(), so the resulting commit
objects are themselves reachable from the usual obj_hash, and thus not
leaked.

No, because lookup_commit() is just about creating an in-process struct.
It doesn't look at the object database at all (though it would complain
if we had seen the same oid in-process as another type).
