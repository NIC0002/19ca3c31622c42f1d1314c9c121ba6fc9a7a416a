OK, so we can guess it has to do with the "--edit" option specifically,
and your editor is doing what we'd expect. The main thing that code is
doing is just opening the editor, but there's this curious bit of code
before it does so:

  $ sed -ne '851,+11p' builtin/config.c
  		if (use_global_config) {
  			int fd = open(config_file, O_CREAT | O_EXCL | O_WRONLY, 0666);
  			if (fd >= 0) {
  				char *content = default_user_config();
  				write_str_in_full(fd, content);
  				free(content);
  				close(fd);
  			}
  			else if (errno != EEXIST)
  				die_errno(_("cannot create configuration file %s"), config_file);
  		}
  		launch_editor(config_file, NULL, NULL);

That shouldn't be overwriting your existing file, since O_EXCL will
refuse to open the file in that case.

But I wonder if something funny is going on with the file selection. We
support both the traditional $HOME/.gitconfig location, but also the xdg
location (usually $HOME/.config/git/config, but $XDG_CONFIG_HOME can
tweak that).

When reading config for most commands, we will generally pull from both
sources. But for "git config --global", we have to pick one to operate
on, both for reading and writing. The logic is supposed to prefer
$HOME/.gitconfig, but use the xdg location if it exists and the $HOME
one doesn't.

From your output:

it's picking the $HOME one. You said you had previous contents that were
overwritten. How did you add them originally, and might they have been
in the xdg location? Can you see if there is anything in /root/.config/git?

I admit I still don't know how we'd trigger this case; if the file did
exist then we should never use /root/.config in the first place.

Another left-field possibility: is /root on an unusual filesystem (e.g.,
a networked one) where O_EXCL might not behave as it should?
