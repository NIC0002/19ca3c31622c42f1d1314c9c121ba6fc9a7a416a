The main intention in this series is to stop giving the user a confusing
error "No branch named..." for a branch he may have just created.  I
think the current subject states that better.  But I'm open to change it
in that direction.

OK. I'll reword with that.

That loses important details IMHO, the intention: "avoid the
confusing..", and the reasoning on why we need to check HEAD in all
worktrees.

I understand your suggestion, but my intention along the message is to
maintain the reasoning on the "HEAD", due to an orphan branch is a HEAD
pointing to a non-existing ref.  Maybe "the HEADs in all worktrees"
could be better?

Well seen.  Thanks for reading carefully.

I'll re-roll with that.

This is the main intention in the patch: not showing the confusing error
"No branch named..." for orphan branches.  I'm not sure if I understand
your question...
