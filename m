Right. The committerdate of a tag is a blank string, so sorting on it
was not doing anything.

Sort of. Your committerdate sort was always doing nothing, but due to
the buggy way that the sort handled ties in 2.23 and older, it happened
to do a reverse refname sort instead of a forward refname sort. Now it
does a forward refname sort to break ties.

But the most important change for you is to actually do a real date
sort, so the tie-breaking should not be important either way.
