Ahh, so ignore my last advise in the previous Email. You already read it.

Yes, it's exactly trying to detect this case and not cause a regression
for users expecting 'git grep' to make use of the JIT.

So, beside the W|X memory allocation error, other errors are likely only
to point out limitations of the JIT compiler, e.g. the example I gave in
https://lore.kernel.org/all/2b04b19a-a2bd-3dd5-6f21-ed0b0ad3e02f@grsecurity.net/,
which is, admitted, a made up example that can easily be worked around
by manually prefixing it with '(*NO_JIT)'. It would be a pain having to
do that for *every* pattern, but only doing it for the pathological
cases should be fine. Otherwise more users would have run into it
already and complained about it, no?

Sure, if it would be required for *every*, i.e. "normal" patterns. But
always doing it even for abusive ones doesn't feel right.

The current version of git would fail hard if it fails to JIT compile
"$A". My patch doesn't change that behavior and that's intentional, as I
share Ã†var's thinking about falling back to the interpreter mode for
"complex patterns" (which means pathological cases, really) is a bad
idea. While we might be able to compile the pattern and run it in
interpreter mode, it'll likely have a *much* higher runtime.

Just to get you a glimpse of how much longer, this is what it takes
running the pathological pattern from above's example on git.git:

  $ time git grep -P "(*NO_JIT)$(perl -e 'print "(.)" x 4000')"
  Binary file git-gui/macosx/git-gui.icns matches
  Binary file t/t5000/pax.tar matches
  Binary file t/t5004/big-pack.zip matches
  Binary file t/t5004/empty-with-pax-header.tar matches

  real	44m42,150s
  user	577m14,623s
  sys	0m46,210s


So this grep run eat up ~9.5 *hours* of CPU time. Do we really want to
fall back to something like this for the pathological cases? ...Yeah, I
don't think so either.

Thanks,
Mathias
