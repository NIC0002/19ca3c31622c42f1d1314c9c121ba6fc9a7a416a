I'm not so sure that the date range approach won't bring it's own
problems. What happens outside the date range? i.e. Do we then have
three identities: Before, During, and After, with only 'During' being
defined?

I more see a single date being used as a termination point for an
existing email sequence that defines a retrospective end point for the
mapping of the old email addresses to a single person. Future emails for
the same mailbox will be for a different 'current' person. This would
match the single linked list commit history view using the chronology
heuristic.

The key here being to have a final identity system in place so that you
can uniquely identify the old John Doe, from the newer John Doe`s at the
relevant time point in the mailmap.

The presence of a _sequence_ of name/email changes isn't well defined.
As I remember it we take the name/email updates in sequence and then
apply a last one wins approach. It's not clear what would be done when
we have two, or three different John Doe sequences all mixed in.


A broader issue for the corporate email mailbox systems is those that
are allocated to roles. So you may have Traning1@corp.com thru
Training9@corp.com (we had) and if that training includes practical low
hanging fruit examples from a project, it's difficult to disambiguate
those commits. More likely is say, having TestPC1 - TestPC9 that
included debug commits, perhaps even with pair programming test & debug
sessions, so allocation to individuals (rather than mailbox) becomes a
real problem. Hopefully that's rare in Sean's case.
