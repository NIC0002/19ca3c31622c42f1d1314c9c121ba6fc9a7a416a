My biggest concern with the patch I showed is that it gives no escape
hatch if people don't like the change. Like I said earlier, I don't
think anybody has grounds to complain about the byte-for-byte output
hash changing, as it would be changing once per second. But they may
complain about the cosmetic problem.

One "escape hatch" is to tell them to use "tar -m", but I don't know how
friendly that is. The more obvious one at the Git level is to have
"--current-mtime" or something to get the old behavior. But at that
point, you may as well support "--mtime=now", which is the same amount
of work, and much more flexible.
