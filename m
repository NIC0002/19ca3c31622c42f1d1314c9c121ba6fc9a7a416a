You rang? :)

Yes, IMHO this strbuf_add_separated_string_list() is another example of
why string-list sucks: it doesn't degrade to a natural array type
(because the "util" magic requires a struct). If it were a strvec or
similar, we could just pass "const char **str, size_t len", which would
make the helper function simpler and more generally useful.

I know there may be other reasons to use a string-list in the caller
here, though (looks like it uses "nodup"). So as usual, the situation is
not so simple as "we should just switch types".
