I poked at this a bit more, and it definitely isn't safe. I think the
use of skip_prefix(), etc, is OK, because they'd always stop at an
unexpected newline. But verify_headers() is only confirming that we have
a series of complete lines, and we might end with no "\n\n" (and hence
no commit/tag message). And so the obvious case that fools us is one
where the data simply ends at a newline, but we are missing one or more
headers. So a truncated commit like:

  tree 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890

(with the newline at the end of the "tree" line, but nothing else) will
cause fsck_commit() to look past the "size" we pass it. With all of the
current callers, that means it sees a NUL and bails. So it's not
currently a bug, but it becomes one if we can feed it arbitrary buffers.

Fixing it isn't _too_ bad, and could look something like this:

diff --git a/fsck.c b/fsck.c

And then the tag side would need something similar. I'd probably also
sprinkle some comments in verify_headers() and its callers documenting
our assumptions and what's OK to do (string-like parsing functions work
as long as they stop when they hit a newline). That, plus a few tests
covering the problematic cases to avoid regressions, would probably be
OK.

I think fsck_tree() is mostly fine, as the tree-iterating code detects
truncation. Though I do find the use of strlen() in decode_tree_entry()
a little suspicious (and that would be true of the current code, as
well, since it powers hash-object's existing parsing check).
