This is one of a few cases chainlint recognizes specially by
suppressing the complaint about the broken &&-chain since "&" can
never fail. The fact that a broken &&-chain prior to the "&" would be
missed was considered a reasonable tradeoff rather than complaining
and asking the test author to jump through hoops just to pacify the
linter. So, there are a few known cases when a broken &&-chain is
allowed to slip through, and tightening linting to disallow those
cases would require too many churn-like changes with little or no
benefit.

Now it gets confusing (for me, at least).

I am unable to reproduce any linting errors when running this script
through chainlint, which is why I was more than a little confused by
this patch when I read it, and I was just about to ask for more
information, such as the actual error message.
