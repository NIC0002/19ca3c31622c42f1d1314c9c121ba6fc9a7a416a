Hmph. Interesting that it passes in CI, but not on your local setup.
I wonder why pipes would behave differently. Or perhaps there is even
some configuration different that means we are still running the perl
add--interactive there, though I kind of doubt it (and couldn't find
anything pointing there).

Still, if it fails in at least one spot, it's something we need to deal
with. On the plus side, once we figure out how to fix it, the
hand-grenade of "enable_nonblock() does nothing on Windows" will not be
present anymore. ;)

That implies that your call to enable_nonblock() succeeded, or
pipe_command() itself would have complained, too. Maybe instrument
it like this:

diff --git a/run-command.c b/run-command.c
index 8ea609d4ae..27e79c928a 100644
--- a/run-command.c
+++ b/run-command.c

Normally we stay pretty quiet there and let the caller report any
problems, but it lacks enough context to make a more specific error
report.

This looks plausibly correct to me. ;) We might want to change the name
of the compat layer to enable_pipe_nonblock(), since one assumes from
the function names this only works for pipes.

Thanks for poking at this.
