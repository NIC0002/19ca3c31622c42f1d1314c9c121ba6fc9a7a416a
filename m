I think it's all hidden in the docs, but isn't easy to tease out.

The 'override a multi-value config with a leading empty value"
technique, I think, is covered in the general discussions about how
config values are entered and parsed.

A useful question would be to ask, where did, or would, you look to hope
to find this information? If we put the info in the right place,
sufficient folks will read it.
