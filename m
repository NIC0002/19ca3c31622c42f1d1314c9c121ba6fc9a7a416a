IMO a selection dialog is the second-best solution. The best one is to
make the branch labels selectable somehow via keyboard navigation. I am
not a fan of the here implement behavior, because it is only a
half-solution.

Also, the order of branch labels on a line is not 100% deterministic:
when you create a branch, it goes last, but when you refresh the view,
branch labels are sorted alphabetically (I think). This means you can't
create a branch and delete it right away if there is already a branch on
the commit.

My preference would be to not implement this behavior until it is clear
what it should be.
