The builtin fsmonitor--daemon is a long-running process.  It is
either explicitly started by the user or implicitly started by
clients commands, like "git status", lazily after it is enabled
in the config.  It runs until explicitly stopped (or the workdir
is deleted).

It is designed to be running and watch the filesystem for changes.

Later client commands can ask it for what has changed on disk
since the previous request (checkpoint).  And the only way to
capture that info is to watch the file system as things happen.
(Unless we have a really deep journal, but that often requires
admin access, so we don't use that.)

The fsmonitor daemon is unlike other subordinate commands in Git.
For example, "git fetch" might synchronously invoke "git index-pack"
and communicate over the child's stdin/stdout.  And that child is
bound to a single parent process.

When the daemon starts, it disassociates from the console and
opens a socket or named pipe and listens for requests (REST-like) 
commands.  It is designed to respond to multiple clients concurrently
and over a long time period -- like a daemon or service process.

fsmonitor doesn't read the index.  it's only watching and summarizing
file system events.  And can enumerate the list of changed paths between
two checkpoints in response to a client request.


> 4. Clearing any semaphores created earlier (example 1).

The daemon isn't designed to ever "be done" and hence there are no
on-disk lock files/semaphores.  There might be some opportunities
for startup/shutdown to do some cleanup (temp files and the like),
but I think it is premature to talk about that right now.

Hope this helps,
Jeff
