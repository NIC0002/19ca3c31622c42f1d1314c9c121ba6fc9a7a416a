It cannot use `git send-email -1` I like.

People can use MUA to send email, the only problem is `-i`. I consider the following method

```
[sendemail]
	suppresscc = author
	sendmailCmd = git-neomutt
```

`~/.local/bin/neomutt`

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
neomutt "${@//-i/}"
```

And it can work:

```
‚ùØ git send-email -1
/tmp/5441yKUviQ/0001-TEST.patch
The following files are 8bit, but do not declare a Content-Transfer-Encoding.
    /tmp/5441yKUviQ/0001-TEST.patch
Which 8bit encoding should I declare [UTF-8]?
To whom should the emails be sent (if anyone)? my-another@email
Message-ID to be used as In-Reply-To for the first email (if any)?
Logging in...
Warning: Fcc to an IMAP mailbox is not supported in batch mode

OK. Log says:

X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.38.1

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Result: OK
```

I want to know can we remove `-i` to allow more MUA/MTA? If user want to add something, why not let them

```
[sendemail]
	sendmailCmd = msmtp -i
```

I think it should be easy to realize.

And I'll consider share this tip to neomutt.

Thanks!
