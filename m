Another problem you might not have run into yet: the names given by
rev-list are not quoted in any way, and will just omit newlines. So if
your hook is trying to avoid malicious garbage like "foo\nbar", it won't
work.

Those names are really just intended as hints for pack-objects. I
suspect the documentation could be more clear about these limitations.

I'm not sure what you mean by "one by one", since that is inherently
what rev-list is doing under the hood. If you mean "running a separate
process for each commit", then yes, that will be slow. But if you want
to know all of the names touched in a set of commits, I have used
something like this before:

  git rev-list $new --not --all |
  git diff-tree --stdin --format= -r -c --name-only

A few notes:

  - the names may be quoted if they have metacharacters; use "-z" if
    your reading side can handle it to make things simpler

  - merges are always tricky. I think "-c" will give you what you want
    (showing names which differed from any parent), but I didn't think
    too hard.  Using "-m" definitely would work, but may produce extra
    names (ones where the merge just brought together two lines of
    history, even though the commit where one of those lines touched the
    file may have been excluded via "--not --all").

  - if you are assuming the existing names are good, then probably
    --diff-filter=A would be useful, as it would show only
    newly-introduced names.
