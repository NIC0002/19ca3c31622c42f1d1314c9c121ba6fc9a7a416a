Perhaps. Perhaps not. As I recall, both Felipe and Ã†var expressed
rather serious concerns that git-switch is not yet ready as a proper
git-checkout replacement. Samples of their concerns can be found at
[1] and [2], for instance.

By the way, git-worktree is even older and probably more widely used
than git-switch, yet it is still marked "experimental", as well, and
perhaps rightly so. As far as I understand, for instance, it still
isn't compatible with submodules (though there may have been some
recent work from one of the Googlers in that area?).
