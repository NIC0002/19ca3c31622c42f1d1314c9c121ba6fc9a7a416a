I'm not quite sure what you mean here by "non-greedy repetitions".
Something like:

  # prefer "foo bar" to "foo bar bar"; only matters for colorizing or
  # --only-matching
  git grep -E 'foo.*?bar'

? If so, then yeah, that changes the meaning of a bare "?" and people
might be surprised by it.

Looks like that NO_REGEX line was dropped by 1819ad327b. So I don't
think Apple added it themselves; their version is just based on an older
version of Git (looks like 2.24.3).

I'm not sure. I always assumed our fallback was similar-ish to what was
in glibc and was thus pretty featureful, but that may not be true (it
actually comes from gawk). It looks like we just didn't pull over the
multi-byte parts in a997bf423d (compat/regex: get the gawk regex engine
to compile within git, 2010-08-17).

This seems pretty sensible, regardless of whether we improve multi-byte
support for compat/regex.
