Not necessarily worth a reroll, but the "since we all work..."
fragment could be dropped without any loss of clarity:

    There is no single optimum configuration suitable
    to every situation.

would probably be sufficient.

This leaves the reader hanging somewhat by not saying where

appropriate documentation.

This and all the other bullet points use an odd mix of spaces and TAB
for indentation. They should consistently use one or the other.

Earlier in this thread, Ã†var suggested that it might be worthwhile to
mention an additional possibility: that simply rerunning `git status`
might be sufficient to achieve reasonable speed since the second run
of `git status` may benefit from the filesystem cache having been
primed by the first invocation of `git status`. As such, it may be
overkill for a user to dive into the various options described here.
Hence, to mitigate the possibility of a user doing a lot of research
and extra unnecessary configuration, it might make sense for the very
first bullet point (before this one) to say merely:

    * Do nothing. Subsequent invocations of `git status` may be faster
      simply because the first `git status` primed the filesystem cache.

or something like that (probably more formal, though).

This variable is unused, isn't it, now that you're inlining everything
with here-docs?

Rather than asserting that some preceding code has left the
configuration in a state this test wants, it would be more robust for
this test to forcibly set up the state it wants. Something like this
should work:

    test_might_fail git config ---unset-all core.untrackedCache &&
    test_might_fail git config ---unset-all core.fsmonitor &&

> +       git status | sed "s/[0-9]\.[0-9][0-9]/X/g" >../actual &&

At all costs, avoid escaping the "trash" directory in which this test
is running. All files created by this test should be within the
"trash" directory hierarchy. Therefore, drop "../" from all the
filenames, and instead create these files directly in the "trash"
directory or in some subdirectory of the "trash" directory.

I presume the reason you're escaping the "trash" directory is because
you don't want these untracked "actual" and "expected" files to
pollute the `git status` output you're testing? If so, then you should
probably instead set up a .gitignore file in the "trash" directory to
make `git status` ignore them.

We usually want to avoid having a Git command upstream of a pipe since
the exit code of the Git command will be lost. So, we'd typically do
this instead:

    git status >out &&
    sed "s/[0-9]\.[0-9][0-9]/X/g" out >actual &&

> +       EOF

Two comments. First, use <<-\EOF rather than <<-EOF to make it clear
to readers that you're not interpolating any variables in the here-doc
body. Second, the <<- operator allows you to indent the here-doc body
(with TABs, not spaces), so you can align the body with the rest of
the code:

    cat >expected <<-\EOF &&
    On branch test
    ...
    EOF

> +       test_cmp ../expected ../actual &&
> +       rm -fr ../actual ../expected
> +'

We usually don't bother cleaning up these files if they don't impact
subsequent tests negatively. However, note that if any code above the
`rm -fr` command fails, then the `rm -fr` command itself won't be run,
hence the files won't get cleaned up upon test failure. To ensure
cleanup (if that's what you desire), use test_when_finished() _before_
code which may fail. So, something like this is typical:

    test_expect_success 'when core.untrackedCache and fsmonitor are unset' '
        test_when_finished "rm -fr actual expected" &&
        test_might_fail git config ---unset-all core.untrackedCache &&
        test_might_fail git config ---unset-all core.fsmonitor &&
        ...
    '

Same comments apply to the other new tests added by this patch.

Does this need to be inline? Is this a hot piece of code, or is this
merely a premature optimization?

Style is to avoid { } braces for these one-liner bodies.

I think we don't even need the variable "x" in this case, so:

    if (getenv("GIT_TEST_UF_DELAY_WARNING"))
        untracked_in_ms += UF_DELAY_WARNING_IN_MS + 1;

would be cleaner.
