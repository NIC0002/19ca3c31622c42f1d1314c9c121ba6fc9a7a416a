It feels like this ought to be able to work, for the same reason that
"git stash show <TAB>" works. In the non-aliased case, we call into
_git_stash(), and it sees that "show" is already there on the command
line. But in the aliased case, we know "show" is part of the alias but
throw away that information completely, and never feed it to
_git_stash() at all.

I think we could do something like the patch below, though I suspect
there are some dragons with more complicated aliases. I wonder if
__git_aliased_command() needs to be more careful with distinguishing
pure-git-command aliases from the complexity of "!" aliases. Or maybe
the alias stuff is all best-effort enough that this doesn't make
anything worse.

By the way, you'll notice that the splice into "words" happens right
at words[1]. That matches the earlier code that just touches words[1].
But I suspect that isn't right. If we're completing "git -p foo", for
example, then the command is at word[2]. I don't know if this causes any
bugs, since we get to the right completion function based on $expansion,
not any value in $words. But presumably it should be __git_cmd_idx?
