Gross. :)

If we are just going to annotate here, I'd prefer to use UNLEAK(). It
makes it more obvious this is about leak-checking, and doesn't imply
that we otherwise care about the lifetime of this field. Like:

diff --git a/builtin/branch.c b/builtin/branch.c
index e6c2655af6..075e580d22 100644

 		if (!argc)
 			die(_("branch name required"));

It's interesting that the ref_sorting pointer is also static. This goes
back to aedcb7dc75 (branch.c: use 'ref-filter' APIs, 2015-09-23). I
wonder if it was trying to accomplish the same thing (back then we added
directly to the list), though back then we did not have any real
leak-detection tools set up.

It should probably move into the "if (list)" block, but that is
orthogonal to your patch.

As for the more complete fix, I think we'd perhaps want something like
this, which would also detect when --sort is used in a non-list mode (as
your example shows, it's a little complicated because we stuff
configured entries into the same list):
