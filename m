Basically, answer the following: Can you implement a command like the cvs2git that can be re-executed on an idempotent (repeatedly with the same result) basis?

If yes, then you can build your own automation to move code into a submodule from your own VCS system into a git repository and the work with the submodule without the git code-base knowing about this.

If you can go the other way, from git to your other VCS system, repeatedly, then you can go back again. This is likely to be much harder as git has a much richer representation model than is typical of VCS systems.

One way may be sufficient for your purposes. Research how cvs2git works and see whether you are able to emulate its functions.

I would not try to do this inside the git infrastructure. What you may be able to do in my suggestion above, is to restrict how your other VCS system is used and restrict how your team uses git to make the mapping repeatable. This is typical of some environments where there is an SVN repo and a git repo that are mirrored. This does simplify matters particularly if you do not have to modify either system but are building a fa√ßade or wrapper around both.

Keep this as simple as possible to meet a minimum viable set of requirements.
