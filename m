I do think that 'ls-tree' is ultimately (eventually?) the right place for
something like this. But you do make some good points about it perhaps being a
bit early.

Alright. Fair. I think with that additional context, I agree. I was coming from
a "this is a common format to both cone and non-cone modes" not a "this is a
leftover implementation detail from now-deprecated use cases" which is the vibe
I'm getting here.

I still think it would be unfortunate to have a single input parameter that
takes both kinds of specifications and interprets them either as cone or non-
cone depending on config and/or a flag. With cone mode specifications like
'a/b/c' being valid gitignore patterns there's no way of knowing whether the
user actually is supplying a pattern or accidentally supplied a directory in
non-cone mode.

With that in mind, I'd probably suggest something along the lines of having
'ls-tree' only accept cone-mode specifications (e.g. --cone-rules-file or so) to
avoid having the non-cone/cone distinction spread outside the 'sparse-checkout'
command. But that would be leaving non-cone users behind, and I guess we are not
quite there yet.

I guess that would be workable. But I would only want to use the command with
cone-mode patterns, so losing the cone-mode optimisations would be suboptimal.

If the 'ls-tree' path isn't the best way forward right now, do you think it
would be viable to add a subcommand along the lines of 'debug-rules/check-rules'
to sparse-checkout?

Then

     git ls-tree -r HEAD | git sparse-checkout debug-rules

would output only the path that match the current patterns. And

     <...> | git sparse-checkout debug-rules --rules-file <file> --[no]-cone

would be equivalent to setting the patterns with

    cat <file> | git sparse-checkout set --stdin --[no]-cone

before running the command above.

Then all the cone/no-cone pattern specification stuff is still contained within
the 'sparse-checkout' command and the documentation for the sub-command would
reside in the sparse-checkout.tx file next to all the caveats and discussion about
sparse-checkout.
