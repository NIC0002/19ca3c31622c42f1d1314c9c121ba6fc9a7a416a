I see. That should be taken care of by not hard-coding ".git/...", but
using something like "git rev-parse --git-path ...". We are doing that
already, otherwise most of lazygit's other rebase commands wouldn't work
in worktrees.

I see, thanks for the explanation. I agree. Trouble is, I don't have the
capacity to drive such an addition to git status, and I doubt anybody
else would be interested in doing it for me (are you? :-), so...
