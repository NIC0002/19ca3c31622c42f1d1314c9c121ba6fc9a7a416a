Thanks for digging into this further. What you found makes sense to me
and explains what we're seeing.

Interesting. I wish there was an easy way for me to poke at this, too. I
tried installing the Git for Windows SDK under wine, but unsurprisingly
it did not get very far.

Possibly I could try connecting to a running CI instance, but the test
did not seem to fail there! (Plus I'd have to figure out how to do
that... ;) ).

Right, it's susceptible to looping forever in such a case. _But_ a
blocking write is likewise susceptible to blocking forever. In either
case, we're relying on the reading side to pull some bytes out of the
pipe so we can make forward progress.

The key thing is that pump_io() is careful never to initiate a write()
unless poll() has just told us that the descriptor is ready for writing.

If something unexpected happens there (i.e., the descriptor is not
really ready), a blocking descriptor is going to be stuck. And with
xwrite(), we're similarly stuck (just looping instead of blocking).
Without xwrite(), a non-blocking one _could_ be better off, because that
EAGAIN would make it up to pump_io(). But what is it supposed to do? I
guess it could go back into its main loop and hope that whatever bug
caused the mismatch between poll() and write() goes away.

But even that would not have fixed the problem here on Windows. From my
understanding, mingw_write() in this case would never write _any_ bytes.
So we'd never make forward progress, and just loop writing 0 bytes and
returning EAGAIN over and over.

So I dunno. We could try to be a bit more defensive about non-blocking
descriptors by avoiding xwrite() in this instance, but it only helps for
a particular class of weird OS behavior/bugs. I'd prefer to see a real
case that it would help before moving in that direction.
