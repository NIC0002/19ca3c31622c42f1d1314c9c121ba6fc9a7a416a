Ah, I somehow completely forgot about that issue. Despite being one of
the two participants on the thread.

Yeah, after seeing that, I'm quite sure this is a mod_http2 issue. It
would be nice to bisect within the mod_http2 history to find the
culprit, but I'd first have to figure out how to build standalone apache
modules. ;)

I may try to poke at it later if I have time. It might also be worth
submitting a bug report to the mod_http2 folks. I'd hope to have a more
compact reproduction, but it does at least seem to fail reliably for me
(not even racily).
