I never realized what the "OK-" part of "OK-117" was doing either. I
guess I should have gone spelunking through history to find out,
though it wasn't high-priority for me to know with regards to my work
on chainlint.pl, so I never got around to it. I suspect that the "OK-"
trick was discussed and added during the period I was off-list.

It was an intentional design choice, for the sake of simplicity, _not_
to make chainlint.pl a shell syntax checker, despite the fact that it
is genuinely parsing shell code. After all, the shell itself -- by
which test code will ultimately be executed -- is more than capable of
diagnosing syntax errors, so why burden chainlint.pl with all that
extra baggage? Instead, chainlint.pl is focussed on detecting semantic
problems -- such as broken &&-chain and missing `return 1` -- which
are of importance to _this_ project.

So, it was very much deliberate that chainlint.pl does not diagnose an
unclosed here-doc. When making that design choice, though, I wasn't
aware of 99a64e4b73c (tests: lint for run-away here-doc, 2017-03-22),
thus didn't know that our test framework had been allowing such
problems to slip through silently[1].

That said, it doesn't look too hard to make chainlint.pl diagnose an
unclosed here-doc.

[1]: Why is that, by the way? Is `eval` not complaining about the
unclosed here-doc? Is that something that can be fixed more generally?
Are there other syntactic problems that go unnoticed?
