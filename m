But in certain high-reliability and mission critical systems, there are parity checks and communication mechanisms that verify the integrity of data transfers memory-to-memory, memory-to-register, and over inter-CPU bus, and memory-to-disk-storage checks. The result of a corruption on one of my systems would result in a CPU halt rather than blindly accepting the result, taking the faulty processor offline until the cause is investigated and then reloaded or repaired. This applies to any component, including disks, CLIMs, DMA, and anything else in the architecture.

Hi,

I doesn't matter if the system is high-reliability or not. The problem 
is exactly the same.

If you have a CPU register which you add to another CPU register, then 
you need to recompute the parity information on the destination CPU 
register. That basically means you always trust the output of the CPU 
adder. There is simply no relationship between input parity and output 
parity in the linear adder case.

Whenever "parity" information is lost, it opens up the possiblity of 
irrecoverable errors.

That's why I say, that GIT would be better of in that regard with an 
end-to-end, CRC parity mechanism.
