Yep, per the C standard ยง6.3.2.3 #7 [1]:

  A pointer to an object or incomplete type may be converted to a pointer to
  a different object or incomplete type. If the resulting pointer is not
  correctly aligned for the pointed-to type, the behavior is undefined.

To your point, it is probably fine in practice, but I'd lean towards
sticking with a 'char *' to play it safe.

In addition to portability, using '__attribute__((packed))' could hurt
performance (and, in a large index, that might have a noticeable effect).

As for dropping 'ondisk_cache_entry()', I didn't want to drop it only from
the "read" operation (and use something like the "parse left-to-right"
strategy below) while leaving it in "write." And, as you mentioned later,
changing 'ce_write_entry()' is a lot more invasive than what's already in
this patch and possibly out-of-scope.

That makes sense from a technical perspective, but I included the starting
entry offset for readability reasons. It might be confusing to someone
unfamiliar with C struct memory alignment to see every other 'get_be32'
refer to the exact entry it's reading via the 'offsetof()', but have that
information absent only for a few entries. And, the double 'offsetof()'
would still be used by the 'mtime.nsec'/'ctime.nsec' fields anyway.

In any case, if this patch is intended to be a short-lived change on the way
to a more complete refactor and/or I'm being overzealous on the readability,
I'd be happy to change it. :) 

Thanks!
