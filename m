Hi Siddharth

It is a bit hard to comment on the test content when you say they are 
incomplete so we don't know what you're planning on adding in the 
future. I agree with Taylor and Junio that khash is probably not the 
best place to start adding tests (I've not checked how far away from 
upstream our code has drifted over time) but from a quick glance I found 
these tests rather tame. I'd like to see tests that are trying to break 
things, for example adding keys with hash collisions and checking that 
they can still be retrieved, updated  after some have been deleted. You 
could use a hash function that returns the first character of a string 
and add words starting with the same letter to generate collisions.

It is also hard to separate the tests from the framework as a good test 
framework will make it easy to write tests that have good diagnostic 
messages when they fail that pin-point the line where the failure 
occurred and the values used in the comparison that failed. A good 
framework will also minimize the amount of " if (...) return 0" boiler 
plate required when a comparison fails. The tests here do not benefit 
from such a framework.

I think this patch also raises the question of what should be tested by 
our test-tool helper and what should be tested in unit tests. Ã†var 
raised the idea of improving our test-helper tests rather than adding 
unit tests [1]. It would be good to get a response to that point of view.

Finally I would recommend that you chat to your colleagues about the 
expectations around including an explanation of the reasons for a change 
in the commit message and code style for patches posted on this list.

Best Wishes

Phillip

I would appreciate feedback from reviewers on what other tests would be useful for khash.h and if these tests provide enough value.
