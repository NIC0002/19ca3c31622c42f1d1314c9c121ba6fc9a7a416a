I think there's an inherent problem here. A commit signature is over the
entire commit object. But when you send a patch, you don't know the
exact bytes of the resulting commit object. In particular, the
"committer" line will have the ident and timestamp from when the
receiver applies the patch and turns it into a commit.

So commit signatures are generally an attestation by the committer, not
by the author. It's just that the two are usually the same when you are
committing locally.

I think you would need some kind of "author-sig" header that signs the
commit object bytes _without_ the commit header at all. And that assumes
the maintainer's workflow is to never modify a patch in transit, and to
apply it at the exact same spot that you wrote it (so that the parent
and tree ids remain the same).
