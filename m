Things did not turn out to be as simple. After ripping out all
special-casing of GIT_TEST_CMP from a MinGW build, I notice at least one
case that needs special treatment (it's `tar tf` that writes CRLF
output). On top of that, there are prerequisites SED_STRIPS_CR,
GREP_STRIPS_CR and perhaps NATIVE_CRLF that should be reconsidered.

For the time being, I suggest to take Dscho's patch.
