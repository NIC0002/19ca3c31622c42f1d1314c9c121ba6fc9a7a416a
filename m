Thanks for reviewing, and for the good suggestion. I think that
splitting this series in two could be worthwhile, but I'm not sure I
want to make this change for v4.

You could imagine splitting the series there, where the first half would
implement the naive version of `for-each-ref --exclude`, and the second
half would implement jump lists, and make upload- and receive-pack take
advantage of it.

But I think that makes the first half trivial and leaves all of the
complexity in this series to the latter half. I suppose that makes it
easier to graduate the first six or so patches earlier, but they aren't
really all that useful without the remaining patches.

Another split might be:

  - the naive implementation of `for-each-ref --exclude`
  - jump lists, and using them within `for-each-ref`
  - teaching upload- and receive-pack to use the jump list

But juggling this series as three sub-topics feels like it would be
burdensome to the maintainer ;-). So I think I'd rather leave it as-is,
unless you feel strongly.

Thanks,
Taylor
