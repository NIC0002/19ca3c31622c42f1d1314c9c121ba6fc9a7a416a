Can't they just copy and paste the command from the advice message? Even 
if the user does not copy and paste it is not that hard to type it out 
with the benefit of the shell's tab completion. You're basically saying 
this combination of options is unusable in practice because it is too 
much effort to type them. We could look to see if we can make it less 
unwieldy by changing push to allow --force-if-includes=ref imply 
--force-with-lease for instance.

Having a warning in the advice message would definitely help

It is good to mention the man page in the advice but we shouldn't assume 
that users will actually go and read it before running the suggested 
command.

Thanks for clarifying, that is the sort of thing that should be in the 
commit message.
