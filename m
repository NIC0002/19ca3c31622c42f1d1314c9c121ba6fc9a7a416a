For the reasons I gave earlier, it has to scrape all of stderr, and not
just progress output. I'm still skeptical that this buys a lot over just
redirecting stderr entirely via the shell, but it's at least
conceptually simple (it's basically the same as a pager for stderr).

The implementation might have some tricky bits to think about, though,
since we have an extra process to handle. For real pagers, we take some
care to terminate them on close. Maybe we wouldn't need the same here,
though (since the filter isn't interactive, and we don't want Git to
wait on exiting until it's done).

So I dunno. It might only be a few lines. It just feels like a weird
feature to add.
