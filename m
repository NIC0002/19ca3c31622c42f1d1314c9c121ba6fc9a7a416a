Just to make things clear, the segfault doesn't exist before my patch.
It's only once we remove the die() call that we need to make sure the
downstream code does the right thing with the resulting NULL, and does
not segfault.

I didn't find any instances, either, but I also didn't look. My
reasoning was mostly that by making the change to this code in
isolation, we could be sure not to have accidental effects in other
code. Now it _could_ be useful to handle NULL in those other call-sites,
but I didn't want making a judgement on that to hold up this fix.

Yes, the segfault possibility was introduced there. But that doesn't
mean the code intended to handle a NULL commit in that case. I think it
ends up doing the right thing, but the behavior is a little
questionable. It actually sees an error from repo_parse_commit(), and
then aborts the whole in_merge_bases_many() operation (not even looking
at the other entries in the "reference" array, although in this caller
it will always be the only element of the array).

So I find it too hard to blame 6cc017431 here; I don't think
is_descendant_of() ever intended to handle NULL, and it was just luck
that it did before then.

So a fix there might be OK, but...

I don't think that does the right thing. We are asking if "commit" is a
descendant of any element in "with_commit". If "with_commit" is empty,
we say "yes" by returning 1.  But if there is no "commit", is the answer
also "yes"? It seems like it should be "no", returning 0.

TBH, I find the existing "return 1" questionable. It comes originally
from 694a577519 (git-branch --contains=commit, 2007-11-07). Back then
the function was used only for checking --contains, where a NULL list
meant "the user did not ask to constrain the list at all".

I think it may be luck that no other caller has relied on that in the
intervening years.

OK, good. That surprised me at first, because the check in
branch_checked_out() doesn't use the same head_rev variable. But it is
just the case that the die() I removed was aborting much earlier, and
now we get far enough to do the right message. The distinction is
relevant because it means that I didn't miss a spot where I should have
checked the behavior of NULL head_rev; the head_rev value is not used
directly here.
