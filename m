I'm thinking mainly about a monorepo context where there are a number of 
distinct 'units' that can be described with sparse checkout patterns. 
And perhaps there's some tooling that only wants to perform an action if 
the content of a 'unit' changes.

Depending on the repo, it won't necessarily be quick to check out the 
commit with the given patterns. However, it is more about it being 
inconvenient to have to have a working directory, especially so if you 
want use the tooling in some kind of service or query rapidly about 
different revisions/patterns.

I was imagining something along the lines of being able to generate new 
tree objects based on what matches the given sparse checkout patterns. 
Not that I have a specific use case for it right now.

I think what I'm trying to evoke with that paragraph is that this 
enables integrations with git that seem interesting and weren't possible 
before.

Ah. Thanks for catching those.

I used 'core_sparse_checkout_cone' because I wanted to allow for the 
cone mode optimisations, but I also figured that I should respect the 
configuration. It doesn't change how the patterns are parsed in this case.

I agree that it is a bit awkward to have to "translate" the directories 
into patterns when wanting to use cone mode. I can try adding
'--[no]-cone' flags and see how that feels. Together with Victoria's 
suggestions that would result in having the following flags:

* --scope=(sparse|all)
* --sparse-patterns-file=<path>
* --[no]-cone: used together with --sparse-patterns-file to tell git
   whether to interpret the patterns given as directories (cone) or
   patterns (no-cone).

Which seems like a lot at first glance. But it allows for passing 
directories instead of patterns for cone mode, and is similar to the 
behaviour of 'sparse-checkout set'.

Does that seem like something that would make sense?

I think my thinking was that it made sense in general for 
'recursively_match_path_with_sparse_patterns()' to expose the match 
result, but then failed to declare it that way. Thanks for catching it.
