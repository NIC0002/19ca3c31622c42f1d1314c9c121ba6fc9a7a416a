This is the first of series towards building the bundle URI feature as
discussed in previous RFCs, specifically pulled directly out of [5]:

[5]
https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.1234.git.1653072042.gitgitgadget@gmail.com

The first patch details the long-term design and goals of the bundle URI
feature, including complicated features such as the bundle-uri protocol v2
verb and bundle lists with heuristics.

However, then intention is to start small with the simplest features that
allow user benefit as soon as possible. In that direction, the rest of this
series creates the ability to run 'git fetch --bundle-uri=' to skip fetching
from any remote and instead download the file at the given . Currently, that
data is expected to be a bundle, which Git will then unbundle and modify the
refs to be in the 'refs/bundle/' namespace.

Currently, the can be a literal filename, a file:// URI, or an http[s]://
URI. Tests are added for both of these cases.

As outlined in [5], the next steps after this are:

 1. Add 'git clone --bundle-uri=' to run this 'git fetch --bundle-uri=' step
    before doing a fetch negotiation with the origin remote. [6]
 2. Allow parsing a bundle list as a config file at the given URI. The
    key-value format is unified with the protocol v2 verb (coming in (3)).
    [7]
 3. Implement the protocol v2 verb, re-using the bundle list logic from (2).
    Use this to auto-discover bundle URIs during 'git clone' (behind a
    config option). [8]
 4. Implement the 'creationToken' heuristic, allowing incremental 'git
    fetch' commands to download a bundle list from a configured URI, and
    only download bundles that are new based on the creation token values.
    [9]

I have prepared some of this work as pull requests on my personal fork so
curious readers can look ahead to where we are going:

[6] https://github.com/derrickstolee/git/pull/18 [7]
https://github.com/derrickstolee/git/pull/20 [8]
https://github.com/derrickstolee/git/pull/21 [9]
https://github.com/derrickstolee/git/pull/22

As mentioned in the design document, this is not all that is possible. For
instance, Ã†var's suggestion to download only the bundle headers can be used
as a second heuristic (and as an augmentation of the timestamp heuristic).


Updates in v2
=============

 * The design document has been updated based on Junio's feedback.
 * The "bundle.list." keys are now just "bundle.".
 * The "timestamp" heuristic is now "creationToken".
 * More clarity on how Git parses data from the bundle URI.
 * Dropped some unnecessary bundle list keys (*.list, *.requires).

Thanks, -Stolee
