I ran some runtime measurements yesterday, and there is a considerable
runtime increase in the unbatched case:

    The tables below show the runtimes of applying each of our semantic
    patches separately with Coccinelle v1.1.1, with the '--all-includes'
    or '--recursive-includes' flags and with batch sizes 1 (no batching)
    or 32, i.e.:
    
      time make SPATCH_FLAGS=$flag SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE=$size $cocci.patch
    
    SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE=1:

    I don't have meaningful numbers about the impact of
    '--recursive-includes' on the runtime of a parallel 'make -j<N>
    coccicheck', because they're severely skewed by 'unused.cocci' and
    'make's scheduler: applying 'unused.cocci' takes 5-10x as long as
    other semantic patches (accounting for about 38-42% of the total
    sequential runtime), and 'make' on my system usually schedules it near
    the end, meaning that for a significant part there is no parallel
    processing at all.

So I'm not sure about making '--recursive-includes' the default, at
least as long as we don't batch by default.  However, we could still
use this flag in CI...

'spatch --help' tells me:

  --recursive-includes    causes all available include files, both
                          those included in the C file(s) and those
                          included in header files, to be used
  --all-includes          causes all available include files included
                          in the C file(s) to be used

So I think the difference is not about system includes, but rather
about "consider includes of includes" vs. "consider only direct
includes in the C files", so it seems '--recursive-includes' is a
superset of '--all-includes'.  Oh, and let's not forget the rather
surprising behavior that if spatch processes multiple C files at once,
then for each of the C files it considers all includes from all C
files; this explains why '--all-includes promisor-remote.c config.c'
works, because 'config.c' does include 'repository.h', supplying the
necessary type information to catch the previously missed
transformation in 'promisor-remote.c'.


These descriptions don't make it clear (to me) whether the two options
are orthogonal, exclusive, or something else.  However, trying out various
combinations indicates that "last one wins", e.g.:
