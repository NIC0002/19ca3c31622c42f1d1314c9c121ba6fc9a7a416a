Correct.  I'm sorry :-/, I meant 0.  My reasoning was to maintain, for NULL
commit, the same result with or without generation_numbers_enabled.  Nothing to
blame on 6cc017431, as nothing states that repo_is_descendant_of needs to
support a NULL commit; but as generation_numbers is not enabled by default, it
is easy to leave that aside if only checked with defaults.  But of course, your
change and 0cc017431 are correct, and your tests cover both execution paths, so
nothing needs to be changed.

My comment was just to suggest that maybe it is worth adding a test for this :-)
If you think it is, maybe this can be useful:

Sorry for the noise.
