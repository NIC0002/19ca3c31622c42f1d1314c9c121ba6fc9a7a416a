The message: "Previous HEAD position was", which we have since dc9195ac78
(Let git-checkout always drop any detached head, 2007-02-03), describes
a detached HEAD that has been left behind.

In 8e2dc6ac06 (commit: give final warning when reattaching HEAD to leave
commits behind, 2011-02-18) we moved this message to a new function,
orphaned_commit_warning().  We still show the message if the HEAD left
behind is detached.  However, if the HEAD left behind is detached _and_
_not connected_ to any ref, instead of the original message, we show a
warning.

In this series, we want to use that function to show the same warning
when the user removes a worktree whose HEAD is detached and _not
connected_ to any ref.  However, if the HEAD is detached but connected,
the original message introduced in dc9195ac78 needs to be adjusted.

This is about the message introduced in dc9195ac78, but...

I think you are referring to the warning.

Starting from a situation like:

   $ git checkout -b foo
   Switched to a new branch 'foo'

   $ git checkout --detach
   HEAD is now at 47ab99a

   $ git commit --allow-empty -m dangling
   [detached HEAD 398a1b0] dangling

   $ git worktree add --detach foo-wt
   Preparing worktree (detached HEAD 398a1b0)
   HEAD is now at 398a1b0 dangling

If we switch to 'foo' in the current worktree, the message is:

   $ git checkout foo
   Warning: you are leaving 1 commit behind, not connected to
   any of your branches:
   
     398a1b0 dangling 
   
   If you want to keep it by creating a new branch, this may be a good time
   to do so with:
   
    git branch <new-branch-name> 398a1b0
   
   Switched to branch 'foo'

And -- this is what we are adding in this series -- the same message if
we remove the worktree 'foo-wt':

   $ git worktree remove foo-wt
   Warning: you are leaving 1 commit behind, not connected to
   any of your branches:
   
     398a1b0 dangling 
   
   If you want to keep it by creating a new branch, this may be a good time
   to do so with:
   
    git branch <new-branch-name> 398a1b0

I apologize, the examples were confusing.  I though it was a good idea
to show the new message next to other messages where we also refer to
the HEAD position.
