According to POSIX, it is "a write() will not block". ;)

I think in practice for Unix systems it means that at least 1 byte is
available.

Yes, that "go back into its main loop" would do that. But that's not
guaranteed to produce progress any time soon. We may just busy-loop
between poll() and write() returning EAGAIN if another descriptor isn't
ready. And if the thing preventing further writes is something the
process on the other side of the pipe can't fix (and thus we in turn
can't help it fix things by doing a read()), then we'll loop forever.
Which (if I understand it) is exactly the case here because the
underlying code refused to do a partial write.
