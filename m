I'd say there's a bug in `git-switch/git-checkout -B` not performing
the same checks as `git branch -f`. As a result, it is possible to get
into a state in which the same branch is checked out in multiple
worktrees, which is probably undesirable. I looked briefly through the
code but don't have the time presently to dig into it.
