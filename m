Hi,

I thought I'd respond to some of your questions with my opinion and
pointers, in case it's helpful...

I think it looks good.

I think it's done and ready for next.

Eric and I weighed in quite a bit on this series, and it changed
direction pretty dramatically, and more than once.  But we eventually
all came to an agreement about what should be done (the hard part),
and this round implements it.  Stolee has diligently fixed or answered
each item I've raised and I'm very happy with this version.

Victoria says I've addressed all her feedback ("Between the RFC and
this version, you've made the changes I was looking for and answered
any remaining questions I had. This series...looks good to me.")[*].
No one else has chimed in with any issues or questions.  I'm probably
biased since it's my series, but I do think this one is ready.

(Sidenote: The series might look a little scary at first, since I was
originally worried with this series that I was going to need to
introduce some kind of backward compatibility break to get the
necessary fixes, or that the performance cost of the fix might be
high, and there's a super lengthy commit message with rationale
because of that.  However, in the end both problems were averted and
it just looks like a cheap and long-overdue fix, but I left the long
rationale I had already written anyway.)

Ã†var's recent opinion on the state of the series was "I think this is
way past good enough."[*].  He's the only reviewer that has commented
since December, leading me to believe the half-dozen or so other
earlier reviewers since August are content with the current shape.

This series seems good to me and I think it's ready, but the topic
branch rename sounds good.
