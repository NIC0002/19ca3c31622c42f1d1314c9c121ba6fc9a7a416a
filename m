Too many "be"'s.

The new text is administrative in nature, aimed at people who will be
modifying strbuf itself. As such, it is unclear why it is being
inserted into documentation aimed at _consumers_ of the strbuf API.
Moreover, with it buried in existing API documentation like this, I
fear that those at whom it is aimed will almost certainly overlook it.

To increase the likelihood that the target audience will indeed read
the new text, I'd suggest placing it in its own comment block very
near the top of the file, possibly prefixed with a loud "NOTE FOR
STRBUF DEVELOPERS" or some such. Further, as the new text is aimed at
strbuf developers, not strbuf consumers, it would make more sense to
use a plain /*...*/ comment block rather than a /**...*/ block.
