It is good to try and future proof things but this seems rather 
hypothetical. I don't really see how the choice of whether 
--rebase-merges is turned on by default is related to the choice of 
whether or not to rebase cousins by default. It is worth noting that the 
default was changed to from rebase-cousins to no-rebase-cousins early in 
the development of --rebase-merges[1] as it was felt to be less surprising.

But aren't you breaking those aliases now when 
rebase.rebaseMerges=rebase-cousins? That's what I'm objecting to. It 
seems like we're breaking things now to avoid a hypothetical future 
change breaking them which does not seem like the right trade off to me.

It also does not fit with the way other optional arguments interact with 
their associated config setting. For example "git branch/checkout/switch 
--track" and branch.autoSetupMerge. If the optional argument to --track 
is omitted it defaults to "direct" irrespective of the config.

The documentation in v6 is certainly quite clear on this point.

Given we're using the same code to parse the command line argument and 
the config setting and we have a test for 
rebase.rebaseMerges=no-rebase-cousins I think we could drop it.

It's not doing nothing though - it is rebasing the branch, it just 
happens that everything fast-forwards so HEAD ends up unchanged. My 
point is that this test should verify the branch has been rebased. Maybe 
you could check the reflog message for HEAD@{0} is

	rebase (finish): returning to refs/heads/override-config-merges-false

By using --force and checking the graph you check that the rebase 
actually happened.

Thanks for working on this
