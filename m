Subject: [PATCH v2 5/6] pipe_command(): handle ENOSPC when writing to a pipe

When write() to a non-blocking pipe fails because the buffer is full,
POSIX says we should see EAGAIN. But our mingw_write() compat layer on
Windows actually returns ENOSPC for this case. This is probably
something we want to correct, but given that we don't plan to use
non-blocking descriptors in a lot of places, we can work around it by
just catching ENOSPC alongside EAGAIN. If we ever do fix mingw_write(),
then this patch can be reverted.

We don't actually use a non-blocking pipe yet, so this is still just
preparation.

Ironically, this ENOSPC bug means that switching away from xwrite() in
the previous patch wasn't necessary (because it's not clever enough to
know that ENOSPC on a pipe means EAGAIN!). But I think handling both
shows the intent, and sets us up better for fixing mingw_write().
