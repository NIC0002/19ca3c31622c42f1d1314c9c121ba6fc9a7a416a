It seems, that I did a mistake.
I thought, that I have tested it based on openSUSE Factory without 
excluding the tests.
It is failing continuously with adding the tests.

I have seen, that Fedora is excluding many tests additionnally for 
s390x. That is another difference in the spec file:
https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/git/blob/rawhide/f/git.spec

We have also identified this week, that chainlint.pl --stats says "0 
tests". That can explain the empty output.

~/rpmbuild/BUILD/git-2.38.1/t> /usr/bin/perl chainlint.pl --stats 
--emit-all chainlinttmp/tests
total: 0 workers, 0 scripts, 0 tests, 0 errors, 0.01s/0.01s (wall/user)

Best regards,
Sarah
