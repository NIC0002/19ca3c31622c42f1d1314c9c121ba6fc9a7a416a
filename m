Correct, the differences from the most likely sequence of commands
of a potential tester on their workstation (which as you point,
most of the time doesn't allow login in as root) is :

  $ sudo -s -H
  # unset SUDO_UID
  # IKNOWWHATIAMDOING=yes ./t0034-root-safe-directory.sh

the unset only relevant for the third option, of course.

Apologies if sounding otherwise, but I can assure I am not offended
by any of this questions, and looking forward to improve in the
documentation with the help you had provided on reviewing it.

I would also like to thank you personally, since I am well aware
that as a not native English speaker, and because Spanish is my
mother's tongue I usually write things in a way that is not natural
or expected and also overly verbose and without expected pauses.  So
having a second set of eyes on it is specially appreciated.

Correct, but more importantly we now allow the sequence documented
in the test case which is also IMHO more comnon and useful, where the
last step might need to run through sudo (unlike the previous ones)

Correct again; guess my intention wasn't clear.  My concern was that by
blocking root, we don't allow for such a test (if it can be written,
since as you pointed out is challenging) to be added and we also lose
the currently failing run which can be used as an "explanation" of sorts
to the question of "is this supported and expected to work?" which I
think the tests help answer and regardless of what is in the documentation.

I ended up doing a bigger refactoring with v3 that split the tests in two and
which I think will help also in the long run, but kept the Documentation patch
independent since it already has your SO and don't want to waste your time
further by having to re-review it.

Assuming that there are no more improvements (or even if they are) to be made
to the documentation would be OK if I follow my own advice and squash it
together with the code change that introduces the change?

Apologies for not doing it earlier, but in my defense I would say that I sent
the currently applied version originally as an RFC ;)

Depending of the way you become 'root' the test could fail as well,
but IMHO the failing should be expected (and as shown in the table
above) was introduced with this change.

The gist is that if we started the whole test with sudo, there is
no way for git (with the current implementation) to differenciate if that
SUDO_UID is relevant only to its current run or to the environment and
more importantly what the intentions are from the user that is running
on that environment.

Alternatively we could ammend the code to allow for such logic but I
don't think that would be easier to implement and I don't see much of
a benefit.

My thinking is that if we are going to let sudo tells us who the user is
then we must trust that SUDO_UID indicates also the intention of the user
behind that environment and therefore it is correct in this case to fail.

If the user really meant to not trust its SUDO_UID and instead use the
id we are running as, then he should have removed it from the environment
before invoking git as documented.

Long term, as you proposed, if we are running as root we might ALSO
consider that any root owned repositories should be fine to trust but
that change is orthogonal to fixing the 'sudo git <command> in my own
repository doesn't work after the last maint release'

It should also be important to note that starting the whole test with
sudo is not trivial, neither expected, and will also block because of
sudo most likely removing the IKNOWWHATIAMDOING environment variable,
so whichever way we decide we shouldn't expect someone accidentally
failing this test.

the test as root without a SUDO_UID would succeed for the wrong reasons
so I agree (and again apologize for suggesting it) that using a
prerequisite to squash that run (as done in the other tests) was wrong.

what I am still not sure about is if it is worth complicating the test
by adding logic that differenciate a root user with and without SUDO_UID
that might run it, and I have to admit that the current draft I have of
v3 does follow your advice of blocking root from even being able to run
it as suggested (and which is also what I am leaning for).

PS. I apologize for not trimming on your responses more aggresively to
save some bytes as I would normally do, but wanted to make sure you
understand that by trimming those parts I wasn't implying they weren't
read or relevant, but just not strictly neccesary and implictly agreed
upon for further discussion
