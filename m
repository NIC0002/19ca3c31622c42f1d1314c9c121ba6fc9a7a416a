Heh. It is a little funny to have an empty block. But at the same time,
it aligns the conditional with all of the skip_prefix() calls, which are
advancing "format" as a side effect of matching.

So I could go either way (and we can always change it on top).

I think based on your responses that there's nothing that would require
a re-roll. The only thing left from my review is the extra parentheses
in format_commit_item, which could possibly be fixed up while applying.
