FWIW, I had the same urge as Ã†var, to drop the non-curl support
completely, and was puzzled that his patch did not have a big code
deletion. ;)

The problem is that the tunnel mode still relies on the non-curl code.
There was a series to address that a while ago:

  https://lore.kernel.org/git/ab866314-608b-eaca-b335-12cffe165526@morey-chaisemartin.com/

but it ran into the problem that curl did not support PREAUTH
connections (which is one of the main points of tunneling). It looks
like that got added to curl via their befaa7b14f, which is in curl
7.56.0 from 2017. That's not old enough for us to require for http, but
might be OK for a marginal component like the tunneling mode of
imap-send.

I think there was also some question of how you even get the tunnel
going. Curl really wants to have a single socket descriptor, not two
pipe descriptors, so there may have to be some trickery with
socketpair(). There's more discussion in the linked thread.

So I think there's a path forward here for getting rid of the legacy
code (and I'd be really happy to see it gone; it's imported code that
does not seem super well maintained by us). But until we do that,
disabling --no-curl doesn't seem like that big a win, if that code can
all still be triggered for tunnel mode.
